This domain was a completely random purchase. Earlier today while taking a break from work (which was sorely needed… I had 3 weeks off over the holidays, and coming back today was _not_ easy), I decided to hop on Mastodon for the first time in quite a while. A friend of mine who was previously on the same instance as me had apparently swapped to a different instance during the month or so that I was gone. I just happened to get lucky enough that another individual I follow happened to boost a toot from him; this friend was using the same avatar on his new instance that he used on the previous instance, so I immediately knew it was him. In seeing what instance he was on, I was a bit surprised. It had a `.pink` TLD. I had no idea `.$COLORS` was a thing now.

I hopped over to my registrar of choice ([Namecheap](https://namecheap.com)) and saw that I could snag a domain for just $2.88 USD. It was a no-brainer. This was especially true because another friend of mine has a saying about the color pink. She doesn’t normally enjoy pink things, but she likes things which are (to quote her) “unusually pink.” A pink heart? Boring. A pink [Razer keyboard and mouse combo](https://www.razer.com/quartz)? Unusually pink and therefore extremely cool. (If you happen to be curious, I own both that keyboard and mouse. They match wonderfully with the pink LEDs in my gaming desktop. Bonus points to me if I’m using them to play Overwatch while wearing my pink Mercy t-shirt.) Hopefully she wasn’t too mad that I snagged this domain. If you’re reading this, I’m sorry. But I did offer up a sub-domain of her choice should she want one!

At any rate, I made the purchase but had no idea what to do with it. After rolling a few things around in my mind, I decided that I would just make a blog on it. I used to blog a _lot_ back in my college days, and I managed to garner enough readership that a few companies would occasionally send me free anime and video games if I promised to write a review on my blog. I lost my luster for writing a few years back, but maybe this will motivate me to do it more frequently. I already had the hosting space available on my VPS currently running [laifu.moe](https://laifu.moe), which doesn’t need all of the resources on the server by a longshot. Plus, I found this sick theme! It’s [Rusty](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-rusty/) from the Hugo Themes gallery. It also gave me an excuse to learn how to use site blocks in Nginx as I’ve used Nginx for years but never with multiple sites on the same server. Spoiler alert: it’s super easy to do.

Hopefully I’ll put up more posts in the near future! They’ll be… unusually pink.
