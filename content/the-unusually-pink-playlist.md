Do you want to listen to the dankest collection of music since my [2018 Spotify wrapped post](https://www.unusually.pink/blog/2018-in-music-spotify-wrapped)? If your answer is yes (and really… I don’t see a single possible reason why it shouldn’t be) then you’re in luck. We are pleased to introduce the [**Unusually Pink Playlist**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/26aNDr4SulSOQm1vEzUMpG). Featuring tracks loved by Brandi and I, most will be more recent discoveries as opposed to old favorites; we don’t really want to start off a brand new playlist with 10+ hours of material right out of the gate… even if it would be _really_ good material.

Brandi and I have a lot in common when it comes to music, but we also a good bit of diversity and different methods of finding new music. We just start putting this playlist together the other day, but you’ll eventually start seeing plenty of indie, hip-hop, and EDM making the rounds along with some pop.

If you find yourself enjoying the playlist, feel free to give it a follow! Song recommendations are always welcome; hit us up on Twitter [@UnusuallyPink](https://twitter.com/UnusuallyPink).
