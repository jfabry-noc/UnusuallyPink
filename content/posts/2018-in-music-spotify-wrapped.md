I’ve used quite a few streaming services for music throughout the years (I feel old remembering when Pandora was new), but Spotify is by far my favorite. The main value I see from it as opposed to similar, competing services is the amount of personalized, curated content that Spotify generates for me on a regular basis. Each Monday I get a Discover Weekly playlist with music I’ve never listened to before but which is similar to other things I’ve enjoyed. Every Friday I get a Release Radar playlist with new releases that also match my taste. These only get better over time as the service learns more and more of what I like.

Along with these weekly goodies, Spotify also does neat stuff for various milestones, and that’s especially true at the end of the calendar year. For example, each December I get a yearly playlist with my top 100 songs from the past year. It’s always an interesting listen to see how varied my tastes were throughout the year. Accompanying that is [Spotify Wrapped](https://spotifywrapped.com) which provides all sorts of interesting statistics about my listening. As someone who keeps Spotify tied to [Last.fm](https://last.fm) because I love statistics, I always look forward to Wrapped. Here are some of my interesting notes from 2018 (no pun intended.)

- 8,131: The total number of unique songs I listened to.
    
- 50,739: The total number of minutes I listened to music.
    
    - For those keeping score at home, that’s over 35 **days**.
        
- My top artist was Tegan and Sara.
    
    - I spent 32 hours listening just to their tracks.
        
- Overall top artists:
    
    1. Tegan and Sara
        
    2. Grimes
        
    3. Eminem
        
    4. Coeur De Pirate
        
    5. St. Vincent
        
- Overall top tracks:
    
    1. RAP DEVIL (Machine Gun Kelly)
        
    2. Los Ageless (St. Vincent)
        
    3. 1940 - AmpLive Remix (The Submarines)
        
    4. Flesh without Blood (Grimes)
        
    5. Do You Feel It? (Chaos Chaos)
        
- Overall top genres:
    
    1. Indie
        
    2. Pop
        
    3. Rock
        
    4. Dance/Electronic
        
    5. Hip Hop
        
- I listened to “non-mainstream” artists 69% more than the average Spotify listener.
    
    - I have no idea what’s considered mainstream or whether Spotify is taking the “average” listener to be all listeners or only Premium accounts. Regardless, it makes me feel special.
        

Here’s to more music in 2019.
