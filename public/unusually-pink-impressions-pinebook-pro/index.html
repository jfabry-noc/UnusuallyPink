  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>In my <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/blog/rip-chrome-os">last post about not using Chrome OS</a>, I neglected to get into <em>what</em> I was replacing my Chromebooks with since that seemed like a lengthy post in its own right. As the title gave away, my switch went to the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/">Pinebook Pro</a> from Pine 64. I had been interested in the original $99 USD Pinebook when that came out a couple of years ago, but it seemed a bit <strong>too</strong> basic for what I wnanted. The Pinebook Pro seemed to offer a more compelling experience for $199. The description on the site even seemed to match exactly what I was wanting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pinebook Pro is meant to deliver solid day-to-day Linux or *BSD experience and to be a compelling alternative to mid-ranged Chromebooks that people convert into Linux laptops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to have to deal with Windows, nor was I wanting to go through a lot of research to find a Windows laptop or Chromebook that I could then convert to a Linux laptop. The Pinebook Pro seemed to take care of this for me while also giving me an outlet to support a great company doing some awesome things for the open source community. I was a little leery on what kind of performance I would get out of an ARM processor and if I would hit any compatibility issues, but so far everything has been buttery smooth.</p>
<h1 id="hardware">Hardware<a href="#hardware" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>The hardware is absurdly nice for a $199 device. The Magnesium alloy body just feels solid and sturdy. It has enough heft to make the laptop feel more expensive than it is without being a pain to carry around. It also just looks sleek given that there&rsquo;s literally nothing on the top, not even branding. It&rsquo;s a spotless, black surface.</p>
<p><img src="/images/UnusuallyPinkImpressionsPinebookPro_IMG_0051.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t normally leave my laptops completely unemblazoned, so I just ordered some stickers for it earlier today. I&rsquo;ll share pictures on the socials once those are on.</p>
<p>Under the hood is the a screen that you almost feel has no business being on a $200 machine. It&rsquo;s a 14&quot; 1080p IPS display that looks absolutely gorgeous. Everything from typing away in a Terminal or blog post to watching videos looks terrific on it.</p>
<p>The keyboard is also surprisingly nice. It&rsquo;s spacious, and the keys have an impressive amount of travel to them. Given that these days I rarely use my personal laptop unless I&rsquo;m doing a lot of typing where I need a physical keyboard, the keys on the Pinebook Pro really deliver. Rarely do I even bother to sit at a desk and connect an external keyboard; the default experience is just fine. The keys have good tactile feedback to go along with that travel distance, so you&rsquo;re never left doubting if you pressed a particular key or not.</p>
<p><img src="/images/UnusuallyPinkImpressionsPinebookPro_IMG_0052.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>You may notice that the keyboard also features literally the only external branding other than the sticker on the bottom of the device. The super key has a Pine 64 logo on it, which is a nice, subtle touch.</p>
<p><img src="/images/UnusuallyPinkImpressionsPinebookPro_IMG_0050.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The trackpad is unfortunately not quite as solid as the keyboard. It doesn&rsquo;t feel particular sensitive and the pointer come across as &ldquo;floaty&rdquo;. Hitting big buttons is fine, but it can be annoying to make more precise movements like grabbing the corner of an application to resize it. If I&rsquo;m using the device for something that&rsquo;s mouse-intensive, I&rsquo;ll typically reach for my <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse">Logitech MX Ergo trackball</a>, but the trackpad is still workable in a pinch.</p>
<p>The speakers aren&rsquo;t bad, but they&rsquo;re about what you expect from laptop speakers. Only Apple seems to posess the voodoo required to make great sounding laptop speakers.</p>
<p>The device comes with a barrel jack charger. You can also charge it via the USB-C port as well, which is what I much more commonly do with the charger which came with my Acer Chromebook 315.</p>
<h1 id="software">Software<a href="#software" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Once the device is booted, you&rsquo;ll be using a customized Debian Linux version that comes from the factory.</p>
<p>Distributor ID:    Debian
Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 9.12 (stretch)
Release:    9.12
Codename:    stretch</p>
<p>Being that it&rsquo;s Debian Linux, you can do pretty much anything else that you&rsquo;d expect with Debian Linux&hellip; and that&rsquo;s <strong>awesome</strong>. There are some limitations in the packages simply regarding what software supports ARM and which software does not, but everything I&rsquo;ve tried to do so far has worked fine. That being said, I&rsquo;m mainly still using the device very similar to a Chromebook; I want a web browser and a Terminal.</p>
<p><img src="/images/UnusuallyPinkImpressionsPinebookPro_Screenshotat2020-02-0915-17-28.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The ARM processor and included 4 GB of RAM do an excellent job of keeping everything snappy. It&rsquo;ll occasionally take a little bit longer to launch a heavier application, but otherwise it&rsquo;s often easy to forget that I&rsquo;m on a $200 Linux laptop and not my $2000 MacBook Pro for work. The 64 GB of local storage is a nice change from most Chromebooks as well. Rarely is my system ever bumping its head against the hardware, even when I&rsquo;m streaming music and have a bunch of browser tabs open.</p>
<p><img src="/images/UnusuallyPinkImpressionsPinebookPro_image-asset.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Need to install something new? Just <code>sudo apt install package-name</code> and you&rsquo;re good to go! That being said, just like normal with Debian you get a wide array of software out of the box&hellip; all of which still only amounts to a 5 GB footprint in what comes from the factory.</p>
<h1 id="to-do">To Do<a href="#to-do" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>There are a few things to do out of the box when you get a Pinebook Pro; I would <strong>highly</strong> recommend reading <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro">the wiki page</a> about the device so you know what those are instead of trying to do things on your own. For example, there&rsquo;s no traditional &ldquo;first run&rdquo; experience to set things up given that this is a highly customized Debian image. Instead, you log in with the default credentials <code>rock/rock</code> to get things started. It&rsquo;s highly recommended you <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro#Initial_user_changes.2C_password.2C_name.2C_etc">rename the <code>rock</code> account</a> if you want to keep all of the customizations. If you make a brand new account, which is totally an option if you want to go that route, you&rsquo;ll end up in a session that looks much more like a traditional Debian installation.</p>
<p>While the Wiki does an awesome job of covering what to do when you get the device, my recommendations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable the root account.
<ul>
<li><code>sudo passwd -l root</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install and enable <code>ufw</code> for a firewall.
<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt install ufw</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw enable</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run the <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro#Default_Debian_MATE_Desktop_Quick_Start">system update script</a>.</li>
<li>Update the rest of the system.
<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update the <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro#Trackpad">keyboard and trackpad firmware</a>.</li>
<li>Check your keyboard version to make sure it&rsquo;s on the correct language. Mine came as UK English.
<ul>
<li>If that&rsquo;s not correct, type <code>keyboard</code> at the menu launcher, open the keyboard preferences, go to the <code>Layouts</code> tab, and select the apporpriate layout.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Verify if your timezone is correct or needs to be updated.
<ul>
<li><code>tzselect</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, all of this assumes you&rsquo;re going to keep rolling with the factory Debian image. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro_Software_Release">wide array of operating systems you can choose from</a>. I&rsquo;m personally super tempted to give the <a href="http://www.armbsd.org/arm/">NetBSD image</a> a shot.</p>
<h1 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up<a href="#wrap-up" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m <em>extremely</em> pleased with the Pinebook Pro so far. They&rsquo;ve got a great community, and I&rsquo;ve spent a little time so far keeping tabs on their IRC server and Discord. If you can&rsquo;t find something in particular on the wiki (which would be surprising; it&rsquo;s extremely well-maintained), the helpful folks on IRC can likely assist. If you&rsquo;re a fan of budget laptops but want to move away from Chrome OS or Windows, the Pinebook Pro seems like a great option if you feel comfortable with Linux.</p>
