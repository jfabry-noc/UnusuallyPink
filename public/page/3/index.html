          Continuing with the theme of reading books that spawned movies I thought were terrible but had interesting concepts, I recently read Bird Box. I watched the film for Bird Box back in 2018 shortly after it was released on Netflix, and I wasn&rsquo;t exactly fond of it. So much of the film just didn&rsquo;t seem to make any sense to me, but I really liked the concept of creatures that would create madness in someone simply by seeing them.

          At the end of each year I always look forward to my yearly music stats. I did a post back in 2018 with my Spotify Wrapped statistics, and Brandi and I did a podcast episode on our 2019 music stats. This year is a bit wonky since I used several different music services, but the most relevant metrics I got were from my 2020 Replay from Apple Music. Apple gives a few metrics after getting some flack for historically not providing anything like what Spotify does, but what they did share is at least interesting and worthy of comparison to previous years.

          After spending some quality time with my Pinebook Pro, I decided that I wanted something slightly more powerful for my personal laptop. While most of my heavy-lifting in the world of computers is done with my MacBook Pro for work (which was recently upgraded to a device featuring the new M1 chips; look for more on that soon both here and on the Same Shade of Difference podcast), the Pinebook Pro&rsquo;s extremely weak ARM processor wasn&rsquo;t quite cutting it.

          Between the Thanksgiving holiday and some shifting priorities when I got back to work, I hadn&rsquo;t made any new commits to my GitHub account for about 10 days. This meant that I didn&rsquo;t have any new posts to my recently-launched GitCommit site that makes a bit of a microblog from my commit messages. To be honest, putting it together was really an excuse to have something up at the domain I bought, but I really like the way it turned out.

          Nearly a year and a half ago, I went on a movie binge and watched The Silence. My consensus was that the movie itself was pretty poorly executed with nearly enough plot holes to make me overlook how interesting the overall premise of the story happened to be. I had written:
 Just like with Bird Box, I think the idea is interesting, but the execution of the film was just awful.
