          The coronavirus has been causing havoc for industries across the globe, including the music industry. Especially for small, indie artists, the revenue they make from doing live shows is vital for their ability to continue doing what they love. In the case of a global pandemic, though, all of those shows have been canceled, leaving artists struggling to make it by.
Having been social distancing/self quarantining for about two weeks now, I&rsquo;ve been doing my best to live by the very wise, meaningful words of Craft Brew Geek when he told a group of us:

          Full Disclosure: This won&rsquo;t tell you exactly what was wrong with a website. This will just give you a pretty good, quick idea. I&rsquo;m not in DFIR or even InfoSec. I&rsquo;m just a sysadmin who has some familiarity with a decent number of systems. It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that I did all of these actions from my Linux machine. The same would be possible from macOS or from Windows 10 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

          As you likely know if you listen to the podcast, about 6 months ago I started a new job, and about 3 months ago I moved to be closer to that job. With Brandi&rsquo;s help, I managed to get moved without too much hassle, but I cut a few corners in getting my new home set up. One of those corners was my home network; after using the &ldquo;kit&rdquo; from my ISP to get my Internet service activated I had never bothered to swap out their equipment with my own.

          Having switched to a MacBook Pro for work when I started a new job about 6 months ago, I&rsquo;ve been on an interesting journey in finding new software to fit my workflow after over a decade of operating primarily on Windows for my professional computing. Given that I&rsquo;ve used Linux for years at a personal level, I can typically do anything I need on macOS by opening a Terminal; it&rsquo;s only when I&rsquo;ve got to operate at the graphical level that I can get a little tripped up by the differences between macOS and Windows.

          In my last post about not using Chrome OS, I neglected to get into what I was replacing my Chromebooks with since that seemed like a lengthy post in its own right. As the title gave away, my switch went to the Pinebook Pro from Pine 64. I had been interested in the original $99 USD Pinebook when that came out a couple of years ago, but it seemed a bit too basic for what I wnanted.
