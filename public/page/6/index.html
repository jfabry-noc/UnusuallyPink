          I&rsquo;ve written before about how difficult it can be to record podcasts remotely, something that has continued to be a struggle throughout the pandemic. For the Unusually Pink Podcast, the irritation of recording remotely was enough to make both Brandi and myself decide it was best to throw in the towel after a year. Mark and I have managed to continue doing well with the Same Shade Of Difference podcast, though significantly more work is involved in getting an episode together when done remotely.

          It&rsquo;s not too often these days that I find myself needing to update the underpinnings of PowerShell. The majority of the PowerShell work I do now is based on PowerShell Core, the current version of which is 7.0.3, and frequently just comes with newer versions of the supporting modules. PowerShell Core began with PowerShell 6 and is created with .NET Core, which is Microsoft&rsquo;s open source and cross-platform flavor of .

          Last week the 10.15.7 update to macOS Catalina came with a nice surprise: Safari 14. I was caught off guard by this since I had assumed we wouldn&rsquo;t see Safari 14 until Big Sur released later this year. It was also a nice surprise for me since Safari has become my browser of choice, not just on my iPhone and iPad, but also on my MacBook Pro. The big reason for this is that I do my best to avoid any Chromium-based browser.

          As a follow-up to my last post on GitHub Pages, I mentioned that I moved one of my websites to Firebase. Firebase is a platform from Google for creating web and mobile applications. As a PaaS offering, there are a lot of different parts to the service, but as a platform for web applications hosting is naturally one of them. The free Spark plan offers 10 GB of storage, 360 MB of data transfer per day (which works out to 10 GB of bandwidth per month), and support for custom domains and SSL.

          As I had mentioned in my post about Dropbox Passwords, I&rsquo;m looking to cut down on the number of services that I pay for each month. One of the areas I&rsquo;ve decided to cut down on are my domains; I&rsquo;m letting a few domains that I never ended up finding much of a use for expire rather than having them automatically renew. Some have been renewing like this for years just because I didn&rsquo;t want to lose them for some reason despite never having any real use for them.
