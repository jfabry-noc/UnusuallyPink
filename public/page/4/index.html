          Given that I have technological FOMO while also being a technology masochist, I upgraded my 2018 MacBook Pro to macOS 11 &ldquo;Big Sur&rdquo; as soon as it was available. Common sense dictates that I should have waited a while to let others encounter and fix some of the kinks prior to upgrading myself, but what&rsquo;s the fun in that? I admittedly had a very smooth experience without many issues, and I&rsquo;ve been happily on Big Sur for a few weeks now.

          A few weeks ago I received an email offering to let me try the premium variant of the RememBear password manager for a year for free. I assume that I received this since I currently have an active TunnelBear subscription that I use for my VPN. I didn&rsquo;t bother looking into things too closely, but my understanding is that you can normally use RememBear for free, but syncing your passwords between multiple devices requires a premium subscription&hellip; meaning that in 2020 when people have a phone, a tablet, and at least one computer, a premium subscription is basically a requirement.

          I recently ran into a problem with my keyboard at home, a Logitech K350, AKA a Logitech Wave; the O key stopped reliably working. Sometimes it would work fine, sometimes it would work only when pressed with an excessive amount of force no touch-typist could reliably muster (at which point the key would clank down awkwardly), and sometimes it just wouldn&rsquo;t work at all. Unsurprisingly, the letter O is one that I use with a good bit of regularly, so this presented a problem.

          For anyone who listens to the Same Shade of Difference podcast, you may have heard a brief discussion between Mark and I about how I had switched from Apple Music to Amazon Music. I&rsquo;ve previously been a fan of Spotify, though I became increasingly irritated with the focus they started giving podcasts rather than music. I know it&rsquo;s weird coming from someone who has spent the past couple of years creating podcasts, but I don&rsquo;t listen to them.

          Attack Surface is the latest novel by amazing author and journalist Cory Doctorow. Cory is one of those people with whom almost anyone interested in digital rights and online privacy is likely at least somewhat familiar. While I followed Cory on Twitter (back when I still used Twitter) from my early days on the platform and regularly read his content on Boing Boing, I never read any of his books until Craft Brew Geek convinced me (not that it took a lot of convincing) to read Little Brother and Homeland.
