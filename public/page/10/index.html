          Lately I&rsquo;ve been working through the very arduous (for me) process of learning Go for some personal projects. I selected Go because I typically use interpretted, dynamically typed languages for work, so I thought it would be a good learning experience to work with a compiled, statically typed language. To me at least, Go seemed a bit more approachable than something like C or Rust. I started trying to learn Kotlin since I&rsquo;ve been working with another JVM-based language in Groovy, but it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to use Kotlin from just the command line without an IDE; when I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to add an external package to a project without an IDE I basically gave up on it since it didn&rsquo;t fit at all into my workflow.

          Earlier this week a friend reached out to me regarding a website. He had just finished developing his very first iOS game and was ready to submit it to Apple for approval. One of Apple&rsquo;s myriad requirements, though, is a website containing the author&rsquo;s privacy policy. My friend had no website and no idea how to make one, so he asked me if I could help. It seems wild to me that someone could have the chops to make an iOS app in Objective-C or Swift but not be able to make a website, but each of us has a different skill set.

          Yesterday was the keynote for Apple&rsquo;s 2020 Worldwide Developer Conference. Like so many things right now, the entire conference, keynote included, is virtual due to the coronavirus pandemic. In this case, it&rsquo;s a blessing for the sessions since it means they&rsquo;re all free for anyone to stream as opposed to being a $1500+ USD ticket. Admittedly, though, the keynote left something to be desired. Just a few weeks ago at Microsoft Build, I feel like Microsoft crushed it with their keynote.

          I wrote about a month ago of an update on my Pinebook Pro after switching to Manjaro Linux. I continue to make heavy use of my Pinebook Pro while I&rsquo;m still social distancing and staying at home, giving me lots of time to work on personal projects without much else to do.
Today I ran into an interesting issue, though, after applying a round of updates. I mentioned in my last Pinebook Pro post about going through the process of creating a swapfile using the directions from the Manjaro wiki so that I could hibernate the machine and get much better battery life.

          I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that the title of this post is a bit too verbose, but if someone else had a post online with a title like this it could&rsquo;ve potentially saved me a lot of time. Here&rsquo;s to hoping it helps someone else in their search.
As is mentioned on my personal website, I do a lot of PowerShell and Python scripting for work. Recently, though, I started working in Groovy due to the fact that it&rsquo;s treated as a first-class language in a system I&rsquo;ve been integrating SaaS applications into.
