          As we’ve mentioned in a few podcast episodes, I happen to be a fan of Chromebooks. I have a hulking desktop that I use for things like gaming, programming, and photo editing. That same desktop is also extremely loud and generates enough heat to warm my apartment, whether it needs to be warmed or not. As a result I tend to like having a cheap Chromebook handy when I just need to take care of some email, catch up on my RSS feeds, waste time look at memes on Reddit, or writing posts for our podcast.

          In Episode 11, I had discussed how I run a couple of my websites on a Linux server running Nginx as the web server and encrypting connections to them via Let’s Encrypt certificates. Shortly after recording that episode, though, I realized I had messed up my certificate configuration via certbot. If you don’t recall the episode, I had taken my web server which was only running laifu.moe and added awk.ninja to it so that I had both sites running on the same server.

          I had written back before this site was even on Squarespace about binging movies while I was sick since I don’t normally have the attention span to feel like I’m doing a movie justice; I’m too busy being a millenial who needs to check his phone at least once every 45 seconds. On a somewhat related note, I just got a new phone (look for a post on that in the near future), and I’m not so sure about this whole Digital Wellbeing thing.

          As we mentioned back in Episode 6, I had installed Pop!OS on my desktop. The design of the Pop!_OS interface is very streamlined and minimal to allow you to focus on things without as many distractions as you’ll frequently see in competing operating systems. That’s pretty awesome, but sometimes I want distractions… namely the ones I get by seeing which applications I have up and running in the background. As you’re probably used to seeing, applications like Dropbox and Discord will drop a small icon somewhere in your OS to let you know the applications are running.

          I was recently attempting to sort a list of IP addresses that I had in a text file. PowerShell is awesome at sorting, so I figured I would use it given that I had nearly 2000 of them. I initially just tried to pipe the contents of the file to the Sort-Object cmdlet:
Get-Content -Path .\ipListFixed.txt | Sort-Object
The results were, suffice to say, lackluster. I ended up with something like this:
