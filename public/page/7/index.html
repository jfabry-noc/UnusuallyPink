          I wrote previously about moving this blog from Squarespace to WordPress. One of my cited concerns with Squarespace was being locked into that particular platform without a lot of options for moving somewhere else. So how did I move my content to WordPress? I was able to export the written content for the posts themselves from within Squarespace, fortunately. Inside of Settings &gt; Advanced is an Import / Export option. The only export offering is WordPress, so I guess it was lucky that&rsquo;s where I was moving.

          I tend to pay for a lot of subscription services. In fact, my friend Mark and I have enough of them between us that we needed not one but two episodes of our podcast just to talk about all of our subscriptions. Since the pandemic means I have nothing better to do with my time than sit around and think about things like how much money I spend on subscriptions, though, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about which ones I might be able to do without, which ones I could swap for cheaper services, etc.

          So Long, Squarespace! If anyone stumbles across this site who was previously an Unusually Pink reader, then you might notice that the site looks a bit different after a few months of hiatus. In the short, just under 2 year lifespan of the site it has now moved to its 3rd host. Originally it was hosted on a Vultr VPS that I had been hosting a few other things on, back when I originally bought the domain because I loved the name but had no idea what to do with it.

          The Others I’ve struggled for years with finding a good, reliable, and simple note-taking application that fit my needs and didn’t lock me in to a particular platform. When I started my career, I was using Evernote for handling my notes at work. At the time, the free version of Evernote was pretty solid which was good because I didn’t have the money to be spending on notes. After a few years, however, Evernote apparently decided that not enough people were paying for the premium version of the product; as a result they crippled the free version.

          There&rsquo;s a saying among system administrators:
 It&rsquo;s always DNS.
 Meaning that whenever there’s an issue, DNS is likely the culprit. This morning that adage proved itself yet again.
My home network is currently running off of a Cradlepoint router. Cradlepoint’s specialty is making routers that can leverage LTE, so my router is configured to use my home ISP as the primary WAN link, but it will fail over to a cellular connection if my home ISP is unavailable.
