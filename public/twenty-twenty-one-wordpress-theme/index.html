        <p>While I made the change a few weeks ago, it seems fitting that my first post of 2021 should be about my swap to the Twenty Twenty-One WordPress theme. For anyone who isn&rsquo;t aware, each year WordPress releases a new &ldquo;official&rdquo; theme for the platform. While theme-elitists out there may scoff at them in favor of paid, premium themes, I&rsquo;ve always found the yearly offerings to be elegant and well-designed. I had <em>originally</em> planned on putting this post together on January 1st, but what can I say&hellip; movies on HBO Now aren&rsquo;t going to binge-watch themselves.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve typically enjoyed the yearly WordPress theme releases, the previous iteration of this blog was actually back on the Twenty Sixteen theme since the yearly releases after that one didn&rsquo;t feel like they were a particularly good fit for a blog. I still liked the look of the Twenty Sixteen theme, especially after I switched the colors around to match the <a href="https://unusually.pink/all-dracula-everything/">Dracula Theme</a>, but the fact remains that 2016 is more or less ancient history in the world of web design. As a result, parts of the site just felt a bit&hellip; antiquated. For example, while the banner at the top allowed me to show off the Unusually Pink graphics that we originally commissioned for the podcast, it left the site feeling just a bit old.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cropped-cropped-Unusually-Pink-Facebook-Cover-Photo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The artwork is still amazing, though.</p>
<p>While I spent a decent bit of time tweaking the Twenty Sixteen theme to suit my needs, once I saw the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/09/23/introducing-twenty-twenty-one/">Twenty Twenty-One theme announcement in September I decided to stop further tweaking and try being patient</a>. I also followed a bit <a href="https://github.com/wordpress/twentytwentyone">of the progress on the GitHub repository</a>, but not being a web developer meant that it didn&rsquo;t really give me a good vibe for how the theme would feel in practice.</p>
<p>Once the theme released, though, I immediately found myself drawn to how minimalist and streamlined it is. I feel like it provides me with the bare necessities, and then I can expand upon it from there to fit my needs without a lot of unnecessary overhead. One look at the current layout at the time of this writing probably clues you in to the fact that these aren&rsquo;t the default colors; I once again opted to update the design to feel like the Dracula theme. While Twenty Twenty-One offers less in the customization UI for modifying the colors, it can still easily be done via CSS (a level of access that I sorely missed when <a href="https://unusually.pink/unusually-pink-migration/">the site was hosted on Squarespace</a>.) I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s a better way to do it than just opening the published site in my browser&rsquo;s developer tools and using the inspection feature to get the classes of the objects I want to change, but that ended up getting me to the end result I wanted.</p>
<p>Along with the colors, I also felt the need to adjust some of the font sizes. In the default setup, Twenty Twenty-One opts for <strong>big</strong> fonts, and while they looked kind of nice on my brand new MacBook Pro with a Retina display, on my 1080p, 11&quot; <a href="https://unusually.pink/star-lite-mk-iii/">Star Lite Mk III</a> going to a post would result in just the header and the post title being visible. None of the actual content could be read without scrolling. I wasn&rsquo;t thrilled about my site looking so gigantic on lower resolution displays, so many of the font sizes were tweaked. That being said, as someone with extremely poor vision I&rsquo;m a fan of large-ish fonts, and I didn&rsquo;t want to completely flip to tiny text. Readability is, arguably, one of the most import things on a text-heavy site.</p>
<p>If anyone is curious, my full CSS customizations are below. Hopefully it&rsquo;s not too offensive since frontend is most definitely not my specialty.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While there may still be some minor adjustments for sizes and spacing, for the most part I like where things are at. I&rsquo;ve historically disliked blog landing pages which only showed the beginning of each post, but I&rsquo;ve done a bit of a 180 in that regard. With Twenty Twenty-One I&rsquo;ve been appreciating how the front page is much less cumbersome, especially when trying to reach the links or search box at the very bottom of the page. I think it also provides a bit of a cleaner focus on the <a href="https://unusually.pink/about/">link for the About page</a> that I link to on most of my online profiles.</p>
