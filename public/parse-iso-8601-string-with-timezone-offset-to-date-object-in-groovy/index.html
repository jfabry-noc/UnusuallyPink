        <p>My <a href="https://unusually.pink/groovy-programming-creating-an-iso-date-at-a-specific-date-and-time-in-utc/">Groovy posts always have the absolute worst titles</a>, but I figure that making them verbose is really the only way to make them discoverable. I write a good bit of Groovy code at work, and given that it&rsquo;s been a few years since the heyday of Groovy it can occasionally be a bit of a struggle to figure out exactly what I need with the resources I dig up online. Any time I manage to figure out something that was difficult to find information on, it seems like a good opportunity to fill the gap a bit.</p>
<p>I do a lot of work with APIs, mostly making calls against cloud-based systems. In the cloud, no one generally cares about what timezone you happen to be in, so UTC is always used. I&rsquo;ve recently been making calls against local software platform, though, and <strong>it</strong> returns timestamps in the local time of the server running it. Ick. I ended up with string values like the following which I then needed to parse as a Date object in Groovy for the sake of comparison.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;2020-10-17T02:00:21.644-04:00&quot;
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;m quite familiar with converting something like this <em>without</em> the timezone offset at the end; that one was new for me. My first struggle was exactly what to search for in order to dig up information on this; I eventually discovered that this is <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html">an ISO 8601 date and time format</a>. I first attempted to simply pass this value straight to <code>Date.parse()</code> like I would with something in UTC:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">def dateString <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;2020-10-17T02:00:21.644-04:00&#34;</span>
def dateObject <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Date<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">parse</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;yyyy-MM-dd&#39;T&#39;HH:mm:ss.SSSZ&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">,</span> dateString<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Attempting this gives a really nice error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unparseable date: &ldquo;2020-10-17T02:00:21.644-04:00&rdquo;</p>
<p>Groovy telling me to get bent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After more digging than I care to admit, I finally got to the root of the problem: Groovy doesn&rsquo;t like the colon in the timezone offset. Rather than <code>04:00</code> it wants <code>0400</code>. Given that I work in the western hemisphere, I <em>could</em> have taken the easy route and simply removed the last 3 characters, replacing <code>:00</code> with <code>00</code>. It&rsquo;s not the most elegant solution, though, and there are parts of the world with timezone offsets in fractions of an hour; assuming it&rsquo;s always going to be a whole hour isn&rsquo;t safe. My first take, written last week, was to be extremely complicated by splitting the string into a list at each colon. From there, I concatenated the list items back into a string, separating them with colons, until attaching the very last piece, which is added sans colon:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It technically works but doesn&rsquo;t look so good; no one would ever call the above solution &ldquo;elegant&rdquo; by any stretch. That was done late on a Friday, though, and over the weekend I had a better thought pop into my head. What if instead of spitting up the entire string I simply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verified first that the end of the string matched what was expected.</li>
<li>Took a substring that was everything up until the problematic part of the offset.</li>
<li>Took a substring for the numbers after the last colon.</li>
<li>Put the parts from 2 and 3 together.</li>
</ol>
<p>After shaking off a bit of regular expression rust, this is what I ended up using:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The partial regex match of <code>:\d{2}$</code> validates that the string ends with a colon followed by any 2 digits. If so, I first create a substring from the first index (0) up to the index at the length of the string minus 3, meaning I omit the colon and last 2 numbers. Then I append to that a substring from the overall string&rsquo;s length minus <strong>2</strong> through the end of the string. Using the overall string&rsquo;s length minus 2 rather than 3 means I just leave out the colon.</p>
<p>Is this the best solution? Probably not, but it&rsquo;s getting the job done in my situation. If I ran into issues, my next attempt would be to get the index of every colon in the entire string and then replace the very last one with nothing.</p>
