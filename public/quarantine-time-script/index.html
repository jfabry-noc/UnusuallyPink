        <p>Are you tired of sitting at home wondering how many days you’ve been choosing to quarantine like a responsible adult? Me too! The number of times I’ve been in conversations or working on posts for blogs or social media and thought, “Wait, how long have I been at home now?” followed by wasting time doing rough calendar math in my head was enough that I finally burned some time this weekend putting together a script for it.</p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, every time this has come up before I’ve done some very simple PowerShell to actually calculate this, at least once I passed the point where I couldn’t just think of it off the top of my head:</p>
<pre><code>$now = Get-Date
$then = Get-Date -Date &quot;2020/03/11&quot;
($now - $then).Days
</code></pre><p>Clearly this is extremely simple! I’ve found myself needing a few shell scripts, though, so I figured it would be a good opportunity to write this in Bash instead for a little exposure. The biggest key was to just figure out how the heck to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a date at a specific time.</li>
<li>Subtract the dates.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="date-at-a-specific-time">Date at a specific time<a href="#date-at-a-specific-time" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>This was pretty easy after a quick <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> search. The <code>date</code> utility includes a <code>-d</code> parameter that allows me to give it a string that it’ll use as the date, just like <code>-Date</code> does in PowerShell.</p>
<h2 id="subtract-the-dates">Subtract the dates<a href="#subtract-the-dates" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The second piece also ended up being <em>much</em> more straightforward than I expected. The <code>date</code> utility similarly includes a few codes I can use to specify how I’d like the date to be formatted, including <code>%s</code> which will give the date in seconds relative to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix epoch time</a>. I could get both dates in seconds, subtract the current date from when I started quarantine, and then convert the seconds to days. For those keeping score at home, there are 86,400 seconds in a day.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, <code>date</code> returns the time in seconds just like everything else in the universe that isn’t Java-based. I’m looking at you, <a href="https://failti.me/posts/groovy_prog/">Groovy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-starting-date">Getting a starting date<a href="#getting-a-starting-date" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The easy method would’ve been to hard-code the date when I started quarantine and leave it at that. To make it a little more extensible, though, I instead opted to pass the date as a parameter. Given that people can pass anything as a parameter, though, I put together a regex to enforce the YYYY/MM/DD format on whatever is typed. That being said, I still included an additional check after parsing the starting date regardless since it would still be possible to specify a date that matches the regex but that isn’t real (e.g. 2020/02/31.)</p>
<h2 id="code">Code<a href="#code" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the code in all of its janky glory.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s extremely simple, but it was a fun little learning experience to kill some time on a weekend when I was sitting at home… continuing to quarantine…</p>
