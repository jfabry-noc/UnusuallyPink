  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>It&rsquo;s not too often these days that I find myself needing to update the underpinnings of PowerShell. The majority of the PowerShell work I do now is based on <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell">PowerShell Core</a>, the current version of which is 7.0.3, and frequently just comes with newer versions of the supporting modules. PowerShell Core began with PowerShell 6 and is created with .NET Core, which is Microsoft&rsquo;s open source and cross-platform flavor of .NET. PowerShell version 5 and before, known as Windows PowerShell, is the original, Windows-specific variant of PowerShell. Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t really do any new development work on Windows PowerShell, instead opting to work on PowerShell Core and slowly make the full set of functionality available on all platforms.</p>
<p>This is awesome, but some systems very specifically target Windows PowerShell. This can easily happen since the interpreter even has a different name; Windows PowerShell calls <code>powershell.exe</code> while PowerShell Core calls <code>pwsh.exe</code> in an effort to allow the two versions to co-exist on the same Windows host. As a result, systems which proxy PowerShell commands or scripts on your behalf down to a target machine that have not been updated to expect PowerShell Core will generally target Windows PowerShell instead. This was the situation I found myself in last week.</p>
<p>I was attempting to load a script that I had written into a monitoring platform which will then send my script down to any number of &ldquo;collector&rdquo; machines in order to for it to execute and do the actual data aggregation. In this case, my script failed because it was calling the <code>MSAL.PS</code> module. <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet">MSAL</a> is the Microsoft Authentication Library, and as the name indicates it facilitates authentication to Azure AD. It replaces the older Azure AD Authentication Library (ADAL), and is honestly <em>much</em> nicer to use. The module needs to be installed first, though, and while I had previously installed it on the target system under PowerShell Core, Windows PowerShell is a completely separate entity with a separate space for modules. I remoted to the system and ran the following to handle the installation from an administrative Windows PowerShell session:</p>
<p><code>Install-Module -Name MSAL.PS</code></p>
<p>Instead of joy, I got the following error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING: The specified module &lsquo;MSAL.PS&rsquo; with PowerShellGetFormatVersion &lsquo;2.0&rsquo; is not supported by the current version of PowerShellGet. Get the latest version of the PowerShellGet module to install this module, &lsquo;MSAL.PS&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ick&hellip; some things were a bit old in the Windows PowerShell installation. This was one of the rare instances where the error message didn&rsquo;t tell me <em>exactly</em> how to fix the issue, though, so I did a few searches on this exact error. The trick is that updating <code>PowerShellGet</code> involves not one but two steps.</p>
<p>While <code>PowerShellGet</code> is a module specific for discovering and installing PowerShell packages from the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/">PowerShell Gallery</a>, it leverages Microsoft&rsquo;s much more generic <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet package manager</a>. To get the latest version of PowerShellGet, I <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget?view=powershell-7">first had to make sure I was using the latest version of NuGet</a> by running:</p>
<p><code>Install-PackageProvider Nuget -Force</code></p>
<p>Once that completed, <em>then</em> I was able to successfully update PowerShellGet via:</p>
<p><code>Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force</code></p>
<p>Once the update completes, the current PowerShell session will still be running the old version. I just closed PowerShell, re-launched a new administrator instance, and then successfully installed the module via the same cmdlet from earlier:</p>
<p><code>Install-Module -Name MSAL.PS</code></p>
