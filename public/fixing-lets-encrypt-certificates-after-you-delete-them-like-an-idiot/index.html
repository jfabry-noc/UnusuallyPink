  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>In <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/podcast/episode-11-attach-all-the-storage">Episode 11</a>, I had discussed how I run a couple of my websites on a Linux server running <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a> as the web server and encrypting connections to them via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> certificates. Shortly after recording that episode, though, I realized I had messed up my certificate configuration via <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a>. If you don’t recall the episode, I had taken my web server which was only running <a href="https://laifu.moe">laifu.moe</a> and added <a href="https://awk.ninja">awk.ninja</a> to it so that I had both sites running on the same server. When I added awk.ninja, I had to re-run certbot and get a certificate for it along with the certificate I had for laifu.moe. That’s where I messed up; I got tipped off when I received the following email from Let’s Encrypt letting me know that my certificate for laifu.moe was about to expire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your certificate (or certificates) for the names listed below will expire in 10 days (on 07 Jul 19 12:52 +0000). Please make sure to renew your certificate before then, or visitors to your website will encounter errors.</p>
<p>We recommend renewing certificates automatically when they have a third of their<br>
total lifetime left. For Let’s Encrypt’s current 90-day certificates, that means<br>
renewing 30 days before expiration. See<br>
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/">https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/</a> for details.</p>
<p>laifu.moe<br>
<a href="http://www.laifu.moe">www.laifu.moe</a>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seemed odd to me since I knew I had a <strong>cron</strong> job running to update the certificates. I checked the expiration for the certificate on laifu.moe and saw that it had nearly two months left on it. I checked the certificate applied to awk.ninja and saw the same thing. EXACTLY the same thing in fact. In double-checking the certificate on laifu.moe, I realized that the Common Name was for awk.ninja. I was using the awk.ninja certificate for <em>both</em> of my sites. Oops. What happened was that when I added awk.ninja and re-ran <strong>certbot</strong>, I got the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/FixingLetsEncryptCertificatesAfterYouDeleteThemLikeAnIdiot_certbot.png" alt=""></p>
<p>My thought at the time was that I needed to select ALL of the sites. In reality, this overwrote the configuration I already had on laifu.moe and applied the awk.ninja certificate to both sites. This is where I decided to be really stupid. I decided that I would delete the existing certificates, re-run <strong>certbot</strong> twice (one for laifu.moe and once for awk.ninja), and then be done. I started off by deleting the awk.ninja certificate that was applied to both sites:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">sudo certbot delete --cert-name awk.ninja
</code></pre></div><p>I did the same to delete the laifu.moe certificate. Then I tried to do a vanilla run of <strong>certbot</strong> to get the menu in my screenshot above and individually configure each of my two sites. Instead of getting that menu, though, I received an error message that my sites were pointing to certificates that didn’t exist. <strong>certbot</strong> then exited without giving me any further options. The problem is that my configuration files below still referenced the certificates that I just nuked. Oops.</p>
<pre><code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/awk.ninja
/etc/nginx/sites-available/laifu.moe
</code></pre><p>After thinking about it for a few seconds, it made sense; <strong>certbot</strong> can’t know what’s going on and is expecting me to do some cleanup on the mess I made instead of making assumptions about whether or not I should still have certificates. To keep my life simple, I decided to go back to a clean slate on my <strong>sites-available</strong> configurations since I knew that I could get <strong>certbot</strong> to redo the configuration again as long as I could get it to successfully run. As a result, I just set the configurations for both laifu.moe and awk.ninja back to a super vanilla setup. Just <strong>%s/laifu.moe/awk.ninja/g</strong> on the file below for what I configured on awk.ninja.</p>
<pre><code>server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /var/www/laifu.moe/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name laifu.moe www.laifu.moe;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
</code></pre><p>Once I had that done, I restarted nginx just to make sure it was working and I could hit port 80 for both sites.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">sudo systemctl restart nginx
</code></pre></div><p>With that working, I was able to re-run <strong>certbot</strong> and finally get the menu from my initial screenshot. I first configured a certificate for awk.ninja and its www variant. Once that was done, I ran <strong>certbot</strong> one more time and walked through getting a certificate for laifu.moe and its www-variant. In both instances, I opted to have <strong>certbot</strong> reconfigure the files in <strong>sites-available</strong> to redirect all HTTP traffic for HTTPS. I restarted Nginx one more time and <em>finally</em> I had everything configured the way I wanted with each site using its <em>own</em> certificate.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is to actually troubleshoot the problem instead of just starting off by deleting shit from your server. Also, try staying pink!</p>
