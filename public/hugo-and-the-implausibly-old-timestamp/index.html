  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>Management of one of my blogs is handled through a variety of shell scripts. I have a script for executing <code>hugo</code> to rebuild the site and copy the output of the <code>public</code> directory to the folder where Nginx hosts it, for example. One of my scripts creates a tarball of the site and uses <code>rsync</code> to copy it to another server so that, if my VPS blows up, I can easily retrieve the backup.</p>
<p>After composing <a href="https://unusually.pink/making-a-hash-for-the-html-integrity-property/">yesterday’s post</a>, though, I ran into an error with the backup script. It basically runs the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">tar -zvcf /home/fail/backups/failti_me.tar.gz blog
</code></pre></div><p>This started throwing a warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tar: blog/public: implausibly old time stamp 1754-08-30 16:53:05.128654848 -0550</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It claimed the <strong>public</strong> directory where Hugo publishes the compiled site contents to was created in 1754… which is probably a bit older than seems plausible. My blog still published correctly; it was only <code>tar</code> being salty about the weird timestamp. I used <code>stat</code> to check the directory and confirmed that the timetsamp on when it was modified was completely borked:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">stat blog/public/
</code></pre></div><p>That told me:</p>
<p>File: blog/public/
Size: 4096        Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory

Birth: -</p>
<p>After some searches online I found the following <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/6161">GitHub issue thread</a> confirming that plenty of people other than me were seeing the same problem and that it was still present in the current version of Hugo. While I had initially been confused as to why I suddenly started seeing this now since I hadn’t upgraded Hugo or anything like that, I saw a few comments indicating that placing items in Hugo’s static directory seemed to trigger the issue; I had placed an image there from my last post, and it was the first addition to that directory in quite a while. With some additional searching and testing, I verified I could do the following to simply ignore the warning from <code>tar</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">tar -zvcf /home/fail/backups/failti_me.tar.gz blog --warning<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>no-timestamp
</code></pre></div><p>I didn’t like the idea of having such a wonky date on my filesystem; as a result, I started searching for how I could fix it by manually adjusting the “Modify” timestamp. <code>touch</code> seemed like a likely candidate, and after reviewing the <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/touch.1.html">man page</a> I saw that there was a <code>-t</code> flag for it which would allow me to manually specify the timestamp. I basically just wanted to set it to the current time so I added the following to the my script which recompiles the site, placing it after the build and before <code>rsync</code>ing the contents of the public directory to the Nginx directory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">STUPID<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>date <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;+%y%m%d%H%M&#34;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span>
touch -t $STUPID /home/john/blog/public/
</code></pre></div><p>Sure enough, after running this the resulting <code>tar</code> command has no qualms. Likewise, re-running the <code>stat</code> command from above shows the current date and time as the modified time on the directory. I really hope this bug gets fixed soon since it seems to have been around for a hot minute, but at least I have a workaround for the time being.</p>
