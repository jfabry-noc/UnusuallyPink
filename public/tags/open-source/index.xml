      <description>In my last post about not using Chrome OS, I neglected to get into what I was replacing my Chromebooks with since that seemed like a lengthy post in its own right. As the title gave away, my switch went to the Pinebook Pro from Pine 64. I had been interested in the original $99 USD Pinebook when that came out a couple of years ago, but it seemed a bit too basic for what I wnanted.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unusually.pink/blog/rip-chrome-os&#34;&gt;last post about not using Chrome OS&lt;/a&gt;, I neglected to get into &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; I was replacing my Chromebooks with since that seemed like a lengthy post in its own right. As the title gave away, my switch went to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/&#34;&gt;Pinebook Pro&lt;/a&gt; from Pine 64. I had been interested in the original $99 USD Pinebook when that came out a couple of years ago, but it seemed a bit &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; basic for what I wnanted. The Pinebook Pro seemed to offer a more compelling experience for $199. The description on the site even seemed to match exactly what I was wanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pinebook Pro is meant to deliver solid day-to-day Linux or *BSD experience and to be a compelling alternative to mid-ranged Chromebooks that people convert into Linux laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to deal with Windows, nor was I wanting to go through a lot of research to find a Windows laptop or Chromebook that I could then convert to a Linux laptop. The Pinebook Pro seemed to take care of this for me while also giving me an outlet to support a great company doing some awesome things for the open source community. I was a little leery on what kind of performance I would get out of an ARM processor and if I would hit any compatibility issues, but so far everything has been buttery smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware is absurdly nice for a $199 device. The Magnesium alloy body just feels solid and sturdy. It has enough heft to make the laptop feel more expensive than it is without being a pain to carry around. It also just looks sleek given that there&amp;rsquo;s literally nothing on the top, not even branding. It&amp;rsquo;s a spotless, black surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unusually.pink/images/UnusuallyPinkImpressionsPinebookPro_IMG_0051.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t normally leave my laptops completely unemblazoned, so I just ordered some stickers for it earlier today. I&amp;rsquo;ll share pictures on the socials once those are on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood is the a screen that you almost feel has no business being on a $200 machine. It&amp;rsquo;s a 14&amp;quot; 1080p IPS display that looks absolutely gorgeous. Everything from typing away in a Terminal or blog post to watching videos looks terrific on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyboard is also surprisingly nice. It&amp;rsquo;s spacious, and the keys have an impressive amount of travel to them. Given that these days I rarely use my personal laptop unless I&amp;rsquo;m doing a lot of typing where I need a physical keyboard, the keys on the Pinebook Pro really deliver. Rarely do I even bother to sit at a desk and connect an external keyboard; the default experience is just fine. The keys have good tactile feedback to go along with that travel distance, so you&amp;rsquo;re never left doubting if you pressed a particular key or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unusually.pink/images/UnusuallyPinkImpressionsPinebookPro_IMG_0052.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that the keyboard also features literally the only external branding other than the sticker on the bottom of the device. The super key has a Pine 64 logo on it, which is a nice, subtle touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unusually.pink/images/UnusuallyPinkImpressionsPinebookPro_IMG_0050.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trackpad is unfortunately not quite as solid as the keyboard. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel particular sensitive and the pointer come across as &amp;ldquo;floaty&amp;rdquo;. Hitting big buttons is fine, but it can be annoying to make more precise movements like grabbing the corner of an application to resize it. If I&amp;rsquo;m using the device for something that&amp;rsquo;s mouse-intensive, I&amp;rsquo;ll typically reach for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse&#34;&gt;Logitech MX Ergo trackball&lt;/a&gt;, but the trackpad is still workable in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speakers aren&amp;rsquo;t bad, but they&amp;rsquo;re about what you expect from laptop speakers. Only Apple seems to posess the voodoo required to make great sounding laptop speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device comes with a barrel jack charger. You can also charge it via the USB-C port as well, which is what I much more commonly do with the charger which came with my Acer Chromebook 315.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;software&#34;&gt;Software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the device is booted, you&amp;rsquo;ll be using a customized Debian Linux version that comes from the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributor ID:    Debian
Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 9.12 (stretch)
Release:    9.12
Codename:    stretch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that it&amp;rsquo;s Debian Linux, you can do pretty much anything else that you&amp;rsquo;d expect with Debian Linux&amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;awesome&lt;/strong&gt;. There are some limitations in the packages simply regarding what software supports ARM and which software does not, but everything I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do so far has worked fine. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m mainly still using the device very similar to a Chromebook; I want a web browser and a Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unusually.pink/images/UnusuallyPinkImpressionsPinebookPro_Screenshotat2020-02-0915-17-28.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARM processor and included 4 GB of RAM do an excellent job of keeping everything snappy. It&amp;rsquo;ll occasionally take a little bit longer to launch a heavier application, but otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s often easy to forget that I&amp;rsquo;m on a $200 Linux laptop and not my $2000 MacBook Pro for work. The 64 GB of local storage is a nice change from most Chromebooks as well. Rarely is my system ever bumping its head against the hardware, even when I&amp;rsquo;m streaming music and have a bunch of browser tabs open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unusually.pink/images/UnusuallyPinkImpressionsPinebookPro_image-asset.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to install something new? Just &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install package-name&lt;/code&gt; and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go! That being said, just like normal with Debian you get a wide array of software out of the box&amp;hellip; all of which still only amounts to a 5 GB footprint in what comes from the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;to-do&#34;&gt;To Do&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things to do out of the box when you get a Pinebook Pro; I would &lt;strong&gt;highly&lt;/strong&gt; recommend reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro&#34;&gt;the wiki page&lt;/a&gt; about the device so you know what those are instead of trying to do things on your own. For example, there&amp;rsquo;s no traditional &amp;ldquo;first run&amp;rdquo; experience to set things up given that this is a highly customized Debian image. Instead, you log in with the default credentials &lt;code&gt;rock/rock&lt;/code&gt; to get things started. It&amp;rsquo;s highly recommended you &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro#Initial_user_changes.2C_password.2C_name.2C_etc&#34;&gt;rename the &lt;code&gt;rock&lt;/code&gt; account&lt;/a&gt; if you want to keep all of the customizations. If you make a brand new account, which is totally an option if you want to go that route, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up in a session that looks much more like a traditional Debian installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Wiki does an awesome job of covering what to do when you get the device, my recommendations are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable the root account.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo passwd -l root&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install and enable &lt;code&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt; for a firewall.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt install ufw&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo ufw enable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro#Default_Debian_MATE_Desktop_Quick_Start&#34;&gt;system update script&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the rest of the system.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro#Trackpad&#34;&gt;keyboard and trackpad firmware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check your keyboard version to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s on the correct language. Mine came as UK English.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If that&amp;rsquo;s not correct, type &lt;code&gt;keyboard&lt;/code&gt; at the menu launcher, open the keyboard preferences, go to the &lt;code&gt;Layouts&lt;/code&gt; tab, and select the apporpriate layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify if your timezone is correct or needs to be updated.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tzselect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of this assumes you&amp;rsquo;re going to keep rolling with the factory Debian image. There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro_Software_Release&#34;&gt;wide array of operating systems you can choose from&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m personally super tempted to give the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.armbsd.org/arm/&#34;&gt;NetBSD image&lt;/a&gt; a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; pleased with the Pinebook Pro so far. They&amp;rsquo;ve got a great community, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a little time so far keeping tabs on their IRC server and Discord. If you can&amp;rsquo;t find something in particular on the wiki (which would be surprising; it&amp;rsquo;s extremely well-maintained), the helpful folks on IRC can likely assist. If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of budget laptops but want to move away from Chrome OS or Windows, the Pinebook Pro seems like a great option if you feel comfortable with Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s All About Open Source</title>
      <link>https://unusually.pink/its-all-about-open-source/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>A friend of mine who has been doing some programming (hi, Fy!) recently asked me for some ideas on open source projects they could look at and possibly contribute to. It made me think of what open source software I tend to use on a regular basis… which is a decent amount as someone who runs a few different Linux systems. It seemed like a solid opportunity to compile the Super Official List of Open Source Stuff John Likes™.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine who has been doing some programming (hi, &lt;a href=&#34;http://fyritke.us/&#34;&gt;Fy&lt;/a&gt;!) recently asked me for some ideas on open source projects they could look at and possibly contribute to. It made me think of what open source software I tend to use on a regular basis… which is a decent amount as someone who runs a few different Linux systems. It seemed like a solid opportunity to compile the Super Official List of Open Source Stuff John Likes™. As someone who doesn’t really know much about writing code, I have &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; idea if any of these are good candidates for someone to start contributing to open source; they just happen to be things I use on the regular. Without further adieu and in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notepadhttpsnotepad-plus-plusorg&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://notepad-plus-plus.org/&#34;&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notepad++ has been one of my favorite Windows text editors for as long as I can remember. While it may not be as flashy or as popular as some of the other editors I’ll get to in a little bit (yeah… I’ve got a thing for text editors), it’s hard to top the speed and footprint of Notepad++. It also has at least basic syntax highlighting for almost every programming language under the sun. I also can’t overstate the importance of being able to open a plaintext file at work and having the editor launch &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-studio-codehttpscodevisualstudiocom&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VSCode is another &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unusually.pink/blog/microsoft-edge-insider-its-actually-not-that-bad&#34;&gt;rare example of Microsoft software I enjoy&lt;/a&gt;. While I dislike the large, clunky IDE that is Visual Studio, VSCode is a nice balance between a simple editor and an IDE. It has a large plugin ecosystem that can give you benefits of things like Intellisense and a debugger without being needless. It’s based on the same Electron framework as &lt;a href=&#34;https://atom.io/&#34;&gt;GitHub’s Atom editor&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve found it to be such a nice editor across a wide array of languages that I’ve even taken to installing it on Linux systems for the times when I want a GUI editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious how I configure it, here’s my &lt;strong&gt;settings.json&lt;/strong&gt; file. Note that I mainly use it for PowerShell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{
&amp;ldquo;workbench.colorTheme&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Dracula&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;editor.minimap.enabled&amp;rdquo;: true,
&amp;ldquo;editor.minimap.showSlider&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;always&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;editor.wordWrap&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;editor.scrollBeyondLastLine&amp;rdquo;: false,
&amp;ldquo;files.hotExit&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;powershell.integratedConsole.showOnStartup&amp;rdquo;: false,
&amp;ldquo;editor.fontFamily&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Fira Code&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Fira Mono&amp;rsquo;, monospace&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;editor.fontLigatures&amp;rdquo;: true,
&amp;ldquo;git.ignoreMissingGitWarning&amp;rdquo;: true
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vimhttpswwwvimorg&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vim.org/&#34;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, most of the time when I’m using Linux I’m &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; using a GUI. I feel at home on the command line, which is good considering I run a handful of headless servers that I only ever access via SSH (which happens to be a &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; way to mess with scripting or code from a Chromebook if it doesn’t have support for Linux apps yet.) Vim is the de facto CLI editor for me (sorry Emacs users), and I can install it on literally everything. Most Linux distros also come with either it or Vi installed by default, so it’s ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim has a reputation for being difficult to use, but I don’t really think that’s the case. It’s just that it’s very &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; to use if you’re coming from most modern editors. Once you get accustomed to it, I’ve found it to be perhaps the most easy for editing text effectively. Plus, it has a rich plugin ecosystem for things like syntax highlighting and support. I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen&#34;&gt;Pathogen&lt;/a&gt; as my plugin manager for Vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know my Vim config, this is my typical &lt;strong&gt;.vimrc&lt;/strong&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;execute pathogen#infect()
set hlsearch ignorecase smartcase incsearch relativenumber ruler
set laststatus=2 tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab notitle
syntax on
filetype plugin indent on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;htophttpshishamhmhtop&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hisham.hm/htop/&#34;&gt;htop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;htop is a &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; handy, interactive utility for seeing what the heck is happening in a Linux system. Think of it like the terminal version of the Windows Task Manager. It gives you a nice breakdown of CPU, RAM, and swap usage along with a listing of processes and what each is doing. It also offers and easy way to adjust the nice level of particularly important or greedy processes. It’s an enhancement over the older &lt;strong&gt;top&lt;/strong&gt; utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unusually.pink/images/ItsAllAboutOpenSource_Screenshotfrom2019-05-0617-32-51.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tmuxhttpsgithubcomtmuxtmux&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tmux/tmux&#34;&gt;tmux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tmux is terminal multiplexer, hence the name. If you have no clue what that means, it allows you to take a single terminal and divide it up into multiple virtual terminals. This lets easily have multiple terminals on the screen at the same time with different information on them without having to flip between tabs. Here’s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unusually.pink/images/ItsAllAboutOpenSource_Screenshotfrom2019-05-0618-16-41.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a single terminal window I’ve got Vim open with some simple Go code on the left pane. The right side has two panes; the top pane has Cowsay running while the bottom pane I just used to install Cowsay. While not exact useful in the scenario I set up for this screenshot, it can be really handy for doing something like writing a script in one pane and having a second, smaller pane to the side or top of running it periodically without ever needing to close the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other super handy part of tmux is that you can keep a persistent session going on a remote system without staying connected to it. I can SSH to a server, open tmux, connect to an IRC server, and use it for however long I need. If I want to disconnect from SSH but keep my IRC session going, I can simply detach my current SSH session from tmux but leave tmux running. Then I can close my SSH session. When I later SSH into the system again, I can reattach to the existing tmux session and pick right back up where I left off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;powershellhttpsgithubcompowershellpowershell&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell&#34;&gt;PowerShell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’ve mentioned code a few times in these examples after starting the post off by saying I don’t know what the hell I’m doing when it comes to writing code, PowerShell is the one exception. I basically live in a PowerShell window for work, using it for both my day-to-day management at the CLI and in scripts that I use to automate my work… because work smart, not hard, right? I feel decently proficient with PowerShell, and I’m excited that version 6 is now open source! It’s nice to be able to use the same scripting language and commands to manage Windows servers at work that I use to manage my Linux servers at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t posted anything new in a while (I’ve written &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of stuff but just haven’t thought to post it), but you can see some of my sample PowerShell scripts over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jffail&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve also posted some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer&#34;&gt;/r/DailyProgrammer&lt;/a&gt; challenges as &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/jffail&#34;&gt;Gists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hugohttpsgohugoio&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo is a static site generator. The concept is that instead of needing a CMS (content management system… think something like WordPress) to manage posts, pagination, design, etc. on a website that you can instead do it all via plaintext. Hugo allows you to have HTML templates, CSS, and then posts that are authored as Markdown. When you make a new post or change the site in any way, you can recompile your site which is then output as simple HTML and CSS that you can throw onto a web server. New post? Recompile the site and just move the files. Hugo worries about things like how many posts there should be on a page and will adjust it all for you. Need to change information in your header? Just change it one time in your template file and then recompile; there’s no need to use &lt;strong&gt;sed&lt;/strong&gt; through every page and change each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other static site generators out there (&lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is a popular one), but I’ve found that Hugo is by far the fastest. When your site starts to get large with a lot of pages to parse and generate, generators like Jekyll — which is written in Ruby, an interpreted language — can start to bog down. Hugo is written in Go; it’s literally one binary, and that allows it to be super speedy even when your site is large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nethackhttpsgithubcomnethacknethack&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack&#34;&gt;NetHack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end the post on a fun note, NetHack is an incredible video game. It’s easy to look at it and assume that it’s a simplistic, basic game. It runs in a terminal (though variants with tiles and graphics do exist), and everything in the game is represented as an ASCII symbol. Your character? The @ symbol. A kobold? The letter k. The game is also crazy old… it was released in 1987. Here’s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unusually.pink/images/ItsAllAboutOpenSource_Screenshotfrom2019-05-0618-38-44.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fantasy game so the whole point is to hack-and-slash your way through a procedurally generated dungeon, meaning no two games are the same since each level is random; on top of this is the fact that there are more classes, races, and mechanics than most modern games have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better is that the game is &lt;em&gt;still being updated&lt;/em&gt;. The latest commit on their GitHub repo was yesterday. Pretty nuts. The game is also a marvel of what’s possible in the C programming language. Imagine making something like this without even being able to use objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetHack exists for every operating system on the planet, but if you don’t want to bother with installing it you don’t have to. You can instead just hop on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://alt.org/nethack/&#34;&gt;alt.org NetHack server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, tons of other open source applications I use on the regular — I didn’t even bother getting into operating systems — but these are the ones I use the most frequently and enjoy the most. The most important thing, though… is to &lt;strong&gt;stay pink!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
