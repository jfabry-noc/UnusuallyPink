          Note: In the sample below, I&rsquo;m using Ubuntu Linux as the host for my web server. The instructions should be the same for other flavors of Linux, though the path to your Nginx sites configuration files may be different.
Generally when you navigate to a website, such as https://unusually.pink/, you don&rsquo;t actually get to see the files which live on the server at the location hosting all of the HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other goodies for the site.

          Anyone who knows me, reads the type of things I tweet about, and/or listens to the Same Shade of Difference podcast knows that I&rsquo;m an advocate of online privacy. I&rsquo;m all for blocking trackers, avoiding services from invasive companies like Facebook, and generally trying to keep as much of what I do online known only to me. That being said, while I typically configure my browser to block things like Google Analytics because Google is already a super creepy company that gathers an order of magnitude more data than it should about people, I also see the value in having analytics for a website.

          While I made the change a few weeks ago, it seems fitting that my first post of 2021 should be about my swap to the Twenty Twenty-One WordPress theme. For anyone who isn&rsquo;t aware, each year WordPress releases a new &ldquo;official&rdquo; theme for the platform. While theme-elitists out there may scoff at them in favor of paid, premium themes, I&rsquo;ve always found the yearly offerings to be elegant and well-designed. I had originally planned on putting this post together on January 1st, but what can I say&hellip; movies on HBO Now aren&rsquo;t going to binge-watch themselves.

          Between the Thanksgiving holiday and some shifting priorities when I got back to work, I hadn&rsquo;t made any new commits to my GitHub account for about 10 days. This meant that I didn&rsquo;t have any new posts to my recently-launched GitCommit site that makes a bit of a microblog from my commit messages. To be honest, putting it together was really an excuse to have something up at the domain I bought, but I really like the way it turned out.

          As a follow-up to my last post on GitHub Pages, I mentioned that I moved one of my websites to Firebase. Firebase is a platform from Google for creating web and mobile applications. As a PaaS offering, there are a lot of different parts to the service, but as a platform for web applications hosting is naturally one of them. The free Spark plan offers 10 GB of storage, 360 MB of data transfer per day (which works out to 10 GB of bandwidth per month), and support for custom domains and SSL.

          As I had mentioned in my post about Dropbox Passwords, I&rsquo;m looking to cut down on the number of services that I pay for each month. One of the areas I&rsquo;ve decided to cut down on are my domains; I&rsquo;m letting a few domains that I never ended up finding much of a use for expire rather than having them automatically renew. Some have been renewing like this for years just because I didn&rsquo;t want to lose them for some reason despite never having any real use for them.

          Earlier this week a friend reached out to me regarding a website. He had just finished developing his very first iOS game and was ready to submit it to Apple for approval. One of Apple&rsquo;s myriad requirements, though, is a website containing the author&rsquo;s privacy policy. My friend had no website and no idea how to make one, so he asked me if I could help. It seems wild to me that someone could have the chops to make an iOS app in Objective-C or Swift but not be able to make a website, but each of us has a different skill set.

          If you happened to see this site around the time when the first post went up, you might notice that:
  The site looks very different now.
  A lot of what’s in that first post no longer seems to be true.
  For example, this is not the Rusty theme for Hugo. Those technically savvy would also notice that the site no longer has the same DNS record value as laifu.

          This domain was a completely random purchase. Earlier today while taking a break from work (which was sorely needed… I had 3 weeks off over the holidays, and coming back today was not easy), I decided to hop on Mastodon for the first time in quite a while. A friend of mine who was previously on the same instance as me had apparently swapped to a different instance during the month or so that I was gone.
