      <description>I spend the majority of my computing time on the MacBook Pro that I use for work. For a very long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Safari as my main browser on it. Unsurprisingly, Safari integrates very nicely with the rest of macOS, and I honestly just really like it as a browser.

      <content>&lt;p&gt;I spend the majority of my computing time on the MacBook Pro that I use for work. For a very long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Safari as my main browser on it. Unsurprisingly, Safari integrates very nicely with the rest of macOS, and I honestly just really like it as a browser. Lately, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing increased frustration with Safari and the web as a whole that has had me looking for alternatives. I&amp;rsquo;ll preface this entire post by saying that I could easily work around most of my problems by doing what I&amp;rsquo;ve historically done and using Safari for most things and a different browser for the remainder that don&amp;rsquo;t work well in Safari, but I really dislike having multiple browsers open. While I&amp;rsquo;m not nearly as guilty as most of my colleagues about having an egregious number of tabs open, it&amp;rsquo;s still a pain to deal with swapping between browser windows and finding what site is open where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues&#34;&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issue with Safari is compatibility. As someone who is (mercifully) not a web developer, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if the problem is with WebKit itself, with the utter dominance of the Blink, or a combination of the two, but the web in 2021 feels much like the web of the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s. The difference is that instead of everyone developing specifically for Internet Explorer 6, they&amp;rsquo;re developing for Chrome. Various web conferencing applications, for example, just won&amp;rsquo;t work in Safari. Some of them like Microsoft Teams will flat-out tell you this if you try, while others will let you make the attempt and then not work as expected. I get that this is commonly done so that developers can offer a &amp;ldquo;desktop&amp;rdquo; app via Electron, but it still sucks. My favorite bug from recent memory is that SharePoint will manage to get the selection area mis-aligned with the mouse cursor in Safari, meaning that to click on a particular file or directory I have to just watch the highlighting rather than my cursor and click on something arbitrary; it&amp;rsquo;s either that or I refresh the page and hope for a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of configuration options also make Safari periodically difficult to use in a work environment. For example, 3rd party cookies are blocked by default in Safari. This is &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;, in my opinion, since they should be blocked 99% of the time, yet almost no one outside of the technically minded is going to bother going into their settings to make that change. However, sometimes I need to allow 3rd party cookies, and Safari doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to offer up options for this. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://admin.teams.microsoft.com&#34;&gt;Microsoft Teams Admin Center&lt;/a&gt; is a shining example of this. Without 3rd party cookies, you&amp;rsquo;ll just get an error page. I&amp;rsquo;ve historically had to fire up a different browser in order to access it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final issue, which is definitely Safari-specific, is the update cadence. Most browsers are providing monthly updates. Safari, much like the Internet Explorer of years past, is still tying its major updates with OS updates. This means that &lt;a href=&#34;https://unusually.pink/safari-14/&#34;&gt;while the release of Safari 14 was awesome&lt;/a&gt;, for example, I&amp;rsquo;ll wait much longer for Safari 15 to bring additional improvements than I would with a competing browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I still &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like Safari, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s great in a personal context. For work, though, it&amp;rsquo;s just a bit too inflexible and unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brave&#34;&gt;Brave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary concern with alternative browsers was simply native support. I have a MacBook Pro running an M1 chip, and while translating x86 applications to ARM via Rosetta 2 has been seamless with plenty of applications, I wanted my browsing experience to be as snappy as possible. Tons of applications feature ARM support under Linux, which I&amp;rsquo;ve seen firsthand with my &lt;a href=&#34;https://unusually.pink/unusually-pink-impressions-pinebook-pro/&#34;&gt;Pinebook Pro&lt;/a&gt;. I figured it would only be a matter of time before developers made the necessary tweaks for M1 support. Firefox was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/15/firefox-now-natively-supports-m1-macs/&#34;&gt;one of the first browsers I knew of to support M1 chips&lt;/a&gt;, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if that was the direction I wanted to go. I love Firefox, and I still use it on all of my Linux systems; I&amp;rsquo;m using it to write this post on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://unusually.pink/star-lite-mk-iii/&#34;&gt;Star Lite Mk III&lt;/a&gt; right now. There have been a lot of concerns surrounding the direction of Firefox after &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/firefox-maker-mozilla-lays-off-250-workers-says-covid-19-lowered-revenue/&#34;&gt;Mozilla laid off a large number of staff in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, a group that allegedly included most &amp;ndash; if not all &amp;ndash; of their incident response team. Additionally, I experience many of the same issues with Firefox and the Gecko engine as I do with Safari and WebKit in today&amp;rsquo;s Chrome-centric web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I decided to give Brave a shot. Brave &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-brave-browser-132047721.html&#34;&gt;added M1 support at the very end of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and I already had it installed on my machine to use whenever Safari wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option for all of the aforementioned reasons. I simply swapped it to my default browser and spent the past week using it. Brave is a Chromium fork, meaning it renders pages like Chrome and will experience the same high degree of compatibility across sites. It also can install all of the same extensions as Chrome, though that&amp;rsquo;s far less important than one might think as I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most Chromium forks, all of the Google junk that gets added to Chrome is absent. In fact, Brave&amp;rsquo;s main mission is to be a privacy-focused browser. It features a robust advertising and tracking blocker built-in, with tons of options for configuring exceptions, disabling it entirely for certain sites, and more. What really surprised me was the aggression of blocking that it was capable of. I used the tracking blocker in Safari, for example, and the typical reporting from it would block somewhere around 200 trackers per week. After using Brave for a week, my metrics look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/brave_blocker.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this is in no way an apples-to-apples (no pun intended) comparison since I have Brave blocking both trackers and ads while Safari can only do trackers. The numbers are still staggering after just a week, though, and I was particularly interested in seeing metrics like how much bandwidth was saved by not loading that content. There are also baseline levels of blocking that can be configured, and I initially attempted to go with the Strict option. I quickly found that too many sites flat out broke, so I switched it to Standard with much better results. Additionally, options exist for allowing things like buttons on sites for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. The other bonus is that such robust blocking built in means I didn&amp;rsquo;t need the array of security extensions I may be inclined to install with other browsers. After a week, the only extension I&amp;rsquo;ve added to Brave is one for my password manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nice security feature with Brave is that it offers two different takes on Incognito mode. The first is the traditional Incognito mode where it won&amp;rsquo;t load any cookies from your main browsing session, and any cookies gathered during that Incognito session are removed once it ends. The other option does the exact same as the first, but it also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;routes your traffic through Tor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave has seemingly endless customization, and everything discussed thus far can be toggled off and on in the settings. Don&amp;rsquo;t need Tor with Incognito? You can turn it off so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even show up as an option. In fact, going through the settings to configure Brave is the only real hurdle to using it, and it probably took me about 30 minutes to look through everything and get it set up the way that I wanted. That being said, I found the default configuration to be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good, and for most people who may not care to go through the settings it&amp;rsquo;ll be more than fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave seems great on my battery life with no discernible difference from Safari. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really paid much attention to it, though, because honestly everything seems to scream on an M1 MacBook Pro without using much energy in the first place. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard the fan kick on in the months that I&amp;rsquo;ve used the device, and I literally never pay attention to the battery life. I typically work from various locations around my apartment for the morning and then settle in at my desk with a dock during the afternoon. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked undocked for an entire day a couple of times before and still ended the day with enough battery life to comfortably return to my normal routine the next day without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pleased with Brave. As is typically the case, I&amp;rsquo;m always open to checking out new software, and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in maybe giving Vivaldi, which I&amp;rsquo;ve used on Linux previously, a try on my MacBook once they offer M1 support.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Last week the 10.15.7 update to macOS Catalina came with a nice surprise: Safari 14. I was caught off guard by this since I had assumed we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t see Safari 14 until Big Sur released later this year. It was also a nice surprise for me since Safari has become my browser of choice, not just on my iPhone and iPad, but also on my MacBook Pro. The big reason for this is that I do my best to avoid any Chromium-based browser.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Last week the 10.15.7 update to macOS Catalina came with a nice surprise: Safari 14. I was caught off guard by this since I had assumed we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t see Safari 14 until &lt;a href=&#34;https://unusually.pink/thoughts-on-apples-wwdc-2020/&#34;&gt;Big Sur released later this year&lt;/a&gt;. It was also a nice surprise for me since Safari has become my browser of choice, not just on my iPhone and iPad, but also on my MacBook Pro. The big reason for this is that I do my best to avoid any &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)&#34;&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt;-based browser. Over the last few years we&amp;rsquo;ve seen diversity in browsers erode more and more as new browsers are built based on Chromium (e.g. Brave) while others abandon their own engines in favor of using Chromium (e.g. Opera and Edge.) I personally see this homogeneous browsing platform as being pretty bad for the Internet as a whole, as it opens up the possibility for web developers to focus all of their development on Chrome and ignore everything else. This leads to sites that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; work on Chrome and that ignore web standards, just like we saw back in the day when much of the web was developed with only Internet Explorer 6 in mind. The difference now is the way the web has evolved into an entire platform. In 2004 the main issue was that sites developed just for IE 6 wouldn&amp;rsquo;t quite render properly on other browsers. In 2020, there are entire web apps that straight up won&amp;rsquo;t work on non-Chromium browsers. That&amp;rsquo;s something I can&amp;rsquo;t support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; browsers moving forward with different engines are Firefox (with Gecko) and Safari (with WebKit.) I was previously using Firefox on my laptops, but I became extremely concerned recently when &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/&#34;&gt;Mozilla had massive layoffs and switched their mission to focus on revenue&lt;/a&gt;. I certainly understand that Mozilla needs to make money in order to continue making Firefox, but when a group lays off their entire incident response team, I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly feel warm and fuzzy inside about using the product. I still use it on my Linux installations, but on macOS I switched to Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pleasant part about switching to Safari is that, for the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s been a very slick browser that I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed. While Safari 14 doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything too Earth-shattering or even different from any other browsers, it does bring Apple&amp;rsquo;s offering up to parity with some of the major players. For example, Safari will now &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; display favicons for websites on tabs. How they&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far without supporting them I&amp;rsquo;ll never understand, but it immediately makes a huge difference in quickly finding the tab I want&amp;hellip; and I say this as a person who typically doesn&amp;rsquo;t have more than 10 tabs open at any given time. Tab addicts (you know who you are) will especially appreciate this when Safari starts stacking tabs on top of one another. As another update to tabs, Safari can now preview the content of a page when the mouse is hovered over a tab. This can also be useful for quickly finding the appropriate tab without actually having to switch to anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big change, though, is how Safari communicates with the user about how it has helped protect against invasive tracking. This feature is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; similar to the Protections Dashboard in Firefox. There&amp;rsquo;s an icon to the left of the address bar that can be clicked at any given time to see a breakdown of trackers on the current page. Clicking will also allow me to see the specifics of what trackers are being blocked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/safari_icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a bigger picture, I can also get an overall view of what&amp;rsquo;s been blocked in the past 30 days. I can see which sites were attempting to be the most invasive, and similar to the per-site rendering, each can be expanded to show which trackers they had embedded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/safari_websites.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I can click on the &lt;strong&gt;Trackers&lt;/strong&gt; heading in order to see a list of which trackers appear the most frequently across the sites I&amp;rsquo;m visiting. I can expand those listings to see which specific sites are hosting that tracker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/safari_trackers.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it should come as a surprise to anyone that Google, Bing, and Facebook appear the most frequently after just a short period of testing. It&amp;rsquo;s also interesting to see trackers from both Facebook and Snapchat when I don&amp;rsquo;t use either of those &amp;ldquo;services&amp;rdquo;. It really shows you how pervasive they are across the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can already hear the Apple-haters I know railing on the fact that Firefox already has this feature, in my opinion it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see Apple bringing their browser up to feature parity and offering a more transparent and secure browsing experience to people in a package that &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; does not leverage Chromium but which &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a support team behind it that&amp;rsquo;s more than a skeleton crew. Similarly, you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t see anything like this today in Chrome or Edge, likely because the companies behind them both appear relatively high up in the tracker list.&lt;/p&gt;
