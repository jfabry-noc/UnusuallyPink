          My Groovy posts always have the absolute worst titles, but I figure that making them verbose is really the only way to make them discoverable. I write a good bit of Groovy code at work, and given that it&rsquo;s been a few years since the heyday of Groovy it can occasionally be a bit of a struggle to figure out exactly what I need with the resources I dig up online.

          In my last post, I more or less just complained about what a dumpster fire developing anything for Twitter is. Originally, though, the post was intended to be about what I was developing for Twitter. It’s nothing amazing or even complicated, but it was a fun learning experience… Twitter itself not withstanding. I made a Twitter bot tweeting different shades of pink each day. Since that’ll most likely seem nonsensical to most people, let me explain.

          I recently had an idea to turn the Twitter account for my defunct podcast into a Twitter bot posting a new shade of pink every day; it makes sense because the podcast and Twitter account were centered around the color pink. I didn’t really think anyone would care about this particular bot, but it seemed like a fun project idea to work on. It ended up being an interesting learning experience, but not at all for the reasons I actually expected.

          Background Last week I received a bit of a mystifying alert from Office 365 letting me know that our pool of PSTN dial-out minutes for the month had been 80% consumed. This was mystifying due to the fact that as someone who has managed O365 for nearly a decade I didn&rsquo;t realize there was a pool of minutes. PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) had to be related in some way or another to the capability my company has purchased from Office 365 to have a dial-in option added to our Microsoft Teams meetings.

          I was recently attempting to sort a list of IP addresses that I had in a text file. PowerShell is awesome at sorting, so I figured I would use it given that I had nearly 2000 of them. I initially just tried to pipe the contents of the file to the Sort-Object cmdlet:
Get-Content -Path .\ipListFixed.txt | Sort-Object
The results were, suffice to say, lackluster. I ended up with something like this:

          I’ve recently been spending a lot of my time at work doing PowerShell scripting for a project that’s currently underway. While working on a bit of code late last week I ran into two interesting problems that I had yet to really stumble across despite doing heavy PowerShell scripting against Active Directory for nearly a decade now.
Exporting Non-standard Attributes To CSV My first issue was that I needed to export some non-standard attributes from contact objects in AD to a .
