      <title>RememBear Password Manager</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago I received an email offering to let me try the premium variant of the RememBear password manager for a year for free. I assume that I received this since I currently have an active TunnelBear subscription that I use for my VPN. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother looking into things too closely, but my understanding is that you can normally use RememBear for free, but syncing your passwords between multiple devices requires a premium subscription&amp;hellip; meaning that in 2020 when people have a phone, a tablet, and at least one computer, a premium subscription is basically a requirement.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I received an email offering to let me try the premium variant of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.remembear.com/&#34;&gt;RememBear&lt;/a&gt; password manager for a year for free. I assume that I received this since I currently have an active TunnelBear subscription that I use for my VPN. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother looking into things too closely, but my understanding is that you can normally use RememBear for free, but syncing your passwords between multiple devices requires a premium subscription&amp;hellip; meaning that in 2020 when people have a phone, a tablet, and at &lt;strong&gt;least&lt;/strong&gt; one computer, a premium subscription is basically a requirement. I figured that I may as well give it a shot in order to see if it could possibly tide me over until &lt;a href=&#34;https://unusually.pink/dropbox-passwords/&#34;&gt;Dropbox Passwords&lt;/a&gt; is a bit more mature; a year of free service seems like a good bit of time for the Dropbox team to improve upon their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RememBear apps for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS are all very slick. They feature the same cute, cartoon bear as TunnelBear. If I type in my master password on macOS, the bear will even move its head to follow along as I type. That being said, typing in my master password happens infrequently since the apps on all 3 platforms work really well with Touch ID and Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apps on all 3 platforms also do well with auto-filling passwords for me, including with the browser extension for Safari on macOS. Likewise, the iPadOS app is, mercifully, an iPad application rather than the expanded iOS app. I did run into a few random bugs on macOS where the application would be blank after unlocking it, showing as if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any logins stored. I saw another issue where my logins were all listed, but using the search feature wouldn&amp;rsquo;t return any results even if there were matches. In both cases, closing out of the application and re-opening it fixed the problem, and I only encountered each bug once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/remembear.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding new devices or recovering your account is streamlined with a QR code mechanism that leverages another device which already has RememBear configured on it. This makes the setup quick and easy, though it remains unclear what recourse there is if the master password itself is lost and no other devices are configured. They don&amp;rsquo;t give you anything like the secret word list for Dropbox Passwords or the secret key from 1Password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the nice benefits to RememBear over the immaturity of Dropbox Passwords is that it does offer an option for creating and syncing secure notes. I frequently use these for things like saving WiFi pre-shared keys. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to start using these for saving API keys, too, because RememBear doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer the option to add multiple credential fields for each login. I can also store them, much as I did with Dropbox Passwords, in the provided notes section for each login, though it does make copying and pasting the keys a bit more annoying than in something like 1Password or Bitwarden which simply give you the option to add multiple credential fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue with Dropbox Passwords, though, is unfortunately shared with RememBear: there is no web-only option. Installing the browser extension for Firefox, for example, will not work on my Manjaro Linux laptops because the desktop client is still expected and there is no Linux application. This was really surprising to me since one of the reasons I initially started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://unusually.pink/chromebooks-vpns-and-you/&#34;&gt;TunnelBear as my VPN service was due to the fact that they offered a standalone browser extension that I could use back when I had Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; which couldn&amp;rsquo;t install any type of full-fledged VPN client. Given that RememBear has been around for at least a few years and is by no means a new product, I did a little bit of digging to see if there were any plans to support Linux or Chrome OS (while I no longer use Chromebooks because Google is pretty gross, Chrome OS support would indicate a standalone browser extension.) The latest I could find was a comment from May of 2019 on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remembear/ehpbfbahieociaeckccnklpdcmfaeegd&#34;&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; which simply confirmed Linux and Chrome OS weren&amp;rsquo;t supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its slick, cute, and bear-laden UI, RememBear is probably one of the nicest-looking and most user-friendly password managers around. For the overwhelming majority of people, it also likely ticks all of the boxes they would care about as far as features are concerned. Any Linux users out there, though, will be disappointed with the complete inability to use it with their operating system of choice. Here&amp;rsquo;s to hoping for web support or a standalone browser extension at some point in the future, but for the time being Linux aficionados are better off sticking with something like 1Password or Bitwarden.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unusually Pink Updates: Dropbox, Password Managers, and Ad Blocking</title>

      <description>This will be one of those weird amalgam posts featuring multiple only mildly-related topics but which are too short to be a post in their own right. I though it would be helpful to provide some updates on a few things that Brandi and I have talked about in some of our past episodes. They’re all tech-related… but you already know that from reading the title.
Dropbox Upgrades and Price Increases On June 1st, Dropbox added more features to their Plus plan.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;This will be one of those weird amalgam posts featuring multiple only mildly-related topics but which are too short to be a post in their own right. I though it would be helpful to provide some updates on a few things that Brandi and I have talked about in some of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unusually.pink/podcast&#34;&gt;past episodes&lt;/a&gt;. They’re all tech-related… but you already know that from reading the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dropbox-upgrades-and-price-increases&#34;&gt;Dropbox Upgrades and Price Increases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 1st, Dropbox added more features to their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/individual/plans-comparison&#34;&gt;Plus plan&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been a Plus customer for a couple of years now. It’s less of a “I need to pay for the extra space” situation and more of a “I store some important shit in here and this gives me more peace of mind” situation. The main features from the upgrade, according to the email they sent me, are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Double your storage—save everything with 2 TB (2,000 GB).&lt;br&gt;
World-class sync technology—move out-of-date files off your computer’s hard drive and to the cloud with Dropbox Smart Sync.&lt;br&gt;
Dropbox Rewind—roll back accidental changes to any folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra storage is nice, though suffice to say it’s not exactly something I &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/UnusuallyPinkUpdatesDropboxPasswordManagersandAdBlocking_dropbox_space.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewind seems &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; nice, though. I store a lot of PowerShell scripts in Dropbox, so I could see rewind being useful if I accidentally break one or need to snag an older version for some reason. While I’ve recently been making an effort to check in my bigger, more important scripts with &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/&#34;&gt;Azure DevOps&lt;/a&gt; for version control, smaller ones that I’m the only person likely to use still just go into Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things aren’t all roses and unicorns, though, as the added storage and features come at a cost: $2 USD more per month. This bumps the monthly price up to $12 USD. The good part is that if you go with yearly pricing, you save that $2 a month and pay $120 for the year. I’m actually still on monthly pricing despite having used the Plus service for a few years so I’ll need to move over for sure. While the bonus storage is available now the new pricing isn’t happening for me until July. So before early July I need to swap to yearly billing to avoid paying the extra couple of bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wired-password-manager-recommendations&#34;&gt;Wired Password Manager Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unusually.pink/podcast/episode-8-playlists-and-privacy&#34;&gt;last episode&lt;/a&gt;, Brandi and I spoke a bit about password managers. Right after we recorded that episode &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/best-password-managers/&#34;&gt;Wired published an article all about password managers&lt;/a&gt;. The timing seemed perfect to share it. Of the ones Wired recommends Dashlane is the only that I haven’t used. It also makes me feel good that my preferred password manager, &lt;a href=&#34;https://1password.com/&#34;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;, was Wired’s #1 recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Wired, I love their content but always run into my 5 free articles per month limit. I just happened to see earlier today that they’re &lt;a href=&#34;https://subscribe.wired.com/subscribe/wired/121031?source=EDT_WIR_TWITTER_0_WEEKOFJUNE03_3_ZZ&amp;amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=wired&#34;&gt;doing a deal&lt;/a&gt; where you can snag a year’s subscription for just $10. This includes the print editions plus digital content (normally $50 a year) or just digital if you don’t care about print (normally $30 a year.) I was fortunate enough to see it right when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/WIRED/status/1136709547022848006&#34;&gt;they posted to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I have no clue how long this is running for, but it seems pretty worthwhile if you’re a geek and like tech news. And no… we don’t get anything for promoting this. I just like Wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;browser-ad-blocking&#34;&gt;Browser Ad Blocking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unusually.pink/podcast/episode-8-playlists-and-privacy&#34;&gt;last episode&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed how &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-chrome-could-soon-kill-off-most-ad-blocker-extensions/&#34;&gt;Google was initially thinking about making changes to the webRequest API&lt;/a&gt; that would essentially cripple ad blockers. Like we discussed in the episode, after those initial reports and backlash in January Google had backed off a little and said they would think through how this API update should work. At the end of May, though, it came to light that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/05/29/google-still-plans-to-kill-chromes-existing-adblock-apis/&#34;&gt;Google still plans to nuke the webRequest API pieces that allow current ad blockers to work&lt;/a&gt;… that is &lt;a href=&#34;https://9to5google.com/2019/05/29/chrome-ad-blocking-enterprise-manifest-v3/&#34;&gt;unless you’re a G Suite customer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse is that these proposed changes seem to be in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chromium.org/&#34;&gt;open-source Chromium project&lt;/a&gt;. So unless Microsoft does some work on their fork, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/&#34;&gt;Chromium-based version of Edge&lt;/a&gt; could also be impacted. Suffice to say this gives me some &lt;strong&gt;significant&lt;/strong&gt; pause on my previously mentioned plans to buy a new Chromebook. I’m now re-evaluating what I should do for my laptop situation. And if you haven’t used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox Quantum&lt;/a&gt; recently, now might be a great time to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
