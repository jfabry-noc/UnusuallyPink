          I tend to pay for a lot of subscription services. In fact, my friend Mark and I have enough of them between us that we needed not one but two episodes of our podcast just to talk about all of our subscriptions. Since the pandemic means I have nothing better to do with my time than sit around and think about things like how much money I spend on subscriptions, though, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about which ones I might be able to do without, which ones I could swap for cheaper services, etc.

          The Others I’ve struggled for years with finding a good, reliable, and simple note-taking application that fit my needs and didn’t lock me in to a particular platform. When I started my career, I was using Evernote for handling my notes at work. At the time, the free version of Evernote was pretty solid which was good because I didn’t have the money to be spending on notes. After a few years, however, Evernote apparently decided that not enough people were paying for the premium version of the product; as a result they crippled the free version.

          As we mentioned back in Episode 6, I had installed Pop!OS on my desktop. The design of the Pop!_OS interface is very streamlined and minimal to allow you to focus on things without as many distractions as you’ll frequently see in competing operating systems. That’s pretty awesome, but sometimes I want distractions… namely the ones I get by seeing which applications I have up and running in the background. As you’re probably used to seeing, applications like Dropbox and Discord will drop a small icon somewhere in your OS to let you know the applications are running.

          This will be one of those weird amalgam posts featuring multiple only mildly-related topics but which are too short to be a post in their own right. I though it would be helpful to provide some updates on a few things that Brandi and I have talked about in some of our past episodes. They’re all tech-related… but you already know that from reading the title.
Dropbox Upgrades and Price Increases On June 1st, Dropbox added more features to their Plus plan.
