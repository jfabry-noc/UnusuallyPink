          Anyone who knows me, reads the type of things I tweet about, and/or listens to the Same Shade of Difference podcast knows that I&rsquo;m an advocate of online privacy. I&rsquo;m all for blocking trackers, avoiding services from invasive companies like Facebook, and generally trying to keep as much of what I do online known only to me. That being said, while I typically configure my browser to block things like Google Analytics because Google is already a super creepy company that gathers an order of magnitude more data than it should about people, I also see the value in having analytics for a website.

          While I made the change a few weeks ago, it seems fitting that my first post of 2021 should be about my swap to the Twenty Twenty-One WordPress theme. For anyone who isn&rsquo;t aware, each year WordPress releases a new &ldquo;official&rdquo; theme for the platform. While theme-elitists out there may scoff at them in favor of paid, premium themes, I&rsquo;ve always found the yearly offerings to be elegant and well-designed. I had originally planned on putting this post together on January 1st, but what can I say&hellip; movies on HBO Now aren&rsquo;t going to binge-watch themselves.

          I wrote previously about moving this blog from Squarespace to WordPress. One of my cited concerns with Squarespace was being locked into that particular platform without a lot of options for moving somewhere else. So how did I move my content to WordPress? I was able to export the written content for the posts themselves from within Squarespace, fortunately. Inside of Settings &gt; Advanced is an Import / Export option. The only export offering is WordPress, so I guess it was lucky that&rsquo;s where I was moving.

          So Long, Squarespace! If anyone stumbles across this site who was previously an Unusually Pink reader, then you might notice that the site looks a bit different after a few months of hiatus. In the short, just under 2 year lifespan of the site it has now moved to its 3rd host. Originally it was hosted on a Vultr VPS that I had been hosting a few other things on, back when I originally bought the domain because I loved the name but had no idea what to do with it.

          Full Disclosure: This won&rsquo;t tell you exactly what was wrong with a website. This will just give you a pretty good, quick idea. I&rsquo;m not in DFIR or even InfoSec. I&rsquo;m just a sysadmin who has some familiarity with a decent number of systems. It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that I did all of these actions from my Linux machine. The same would be possible from macOS or from Windows 10 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
