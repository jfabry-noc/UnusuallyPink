          As a follow-up to my last post on GitHub Pages, I mentioned that I moved one of my websites to Firebase. Firebase is a platform from Google for creating web and mobile applications. As a PaaS offering, there are a lot of different parts to the service, but as a platform for web applications hosting is naturally one of them. The free Spark plan offers 10 GB of storage, 360 MB of data transfer per day (which works out to 10 GB of bandwidth per month), and support for custom domains and SSL.

          As I had mentioned in my post about Dropbox Passwords, I&rsquo;m looking to cut down on the number of services that I pay for each month. One of the areas I&rsquo;ve decided to cut down on are my domains; I&rsquo;m letting a few domains that I never ended up finding much of a use for expire rather than having them automatically renew. Some have been renewing like this for years just because I didn&rsquo;t want to lose them for some reason despite never having any real use for them.

          So Long, Squarespace! If anyone stumbles across this site who was previously an Unusually Pink reader, then you might notice that the site looks a bit different after a few months of hiatus. In the short, just under 2 year lifespan of the site it has now moved to its 3rd host. Originally it was hosted on a Vultr VPS that I had been hosting a few other things on, back when I originally bought the domain because I loved the name but had no idea what to do with it.
