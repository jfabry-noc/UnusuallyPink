          As I had mentioned in my post about Dropbox Passwords, I&rsquo;m looking to cut down on the number of services that I pay for each month. One of the areas I&rsquo;ve decided to cut down on are my domains; I&rsquo;m letting a few domains that I never ended up finding much of a use for expire rather than having them automatically renew. Some have been renewing like this for years just because I didn&rsquo;t want to lose them for some reason despite never having any real use for them.

          Earlier this week a friend reached out to me regarding a website. He had just finished developing his very first iOS game and was ready to submit it to Apple for approval. One of Apple&rsquo;s myriad requirements, though, is a website containing the author&rsquo;s privacy policy. My friend had no website and no idea how to make one, so he asked me if I could help. It seems wild to me that someone could have the chops to make an iOS app in Objective-C or Swift but not be able to make a website, but each of us has a different skill set.

          In Episode 11, I had discussed how I run a couple of my websites on a Linux server running Nginx as the web server and encrypting connections to them via Let’s Encrypt certificates. Shortly after recording that episode, though, I realized I had messed up my certificate configuration via certbot. If you don’t recall the episode, I had taken my web server which was only running laifu.moe and added awk.ninja to it so that I had both sites running on the same server.

          If you’re using Let’s Encrypt, now would be a really great time to make sure that you’re ready for them to stop supporting ACME TLS-SNI-01 domain validation. I got an email a couple of days ago (as I assume everyone using Let’s Encrypt did) letting me know this change was coming. I had nothing to actually do, but going through the validation was super easy and is likely worth the time to ensure your site(s) aren’t impacted.
