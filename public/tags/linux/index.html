          One of my favorite aspects of Linux ever since my first Ubuntu 6.06 installation has been the software repository. Back in 2006, installing the overwhelming majority of the software I might need from a supported repository stood in stark contrast with the Windows XP method of searching the web for the software you wanted, finding a download link that didn&rsquo;t seem shady, and then hoping for the best.
Repositories are frequently hosted by the maintainer of a Linux distribution (e.

          As you may recall, I purchased a new Linux laptop from Star Labs a while back. It’s a solid little device, though I admittedly haven’t been using it as much as I anticipated due to my increased reliance on my iPads. For more information on that, look for the new Same Shade Of Difference podcast episode that should be dropping very soon. That being said, because I don’t have the worst operational security ever, I do update my laptop every time I happen to see that something is pending.

          After spending some quality time with my Pinebook Pro, I decided that I wanted something slightly more powerful for my personal laptop. While most of my heavy-lifting in the world of computers is done with my MacBook Pro for work (which was recently upgraded to a device featuring the new M1 chips; look for more on that soon both here and on the Same Shade of Difference podcast), the Pinebook Pro&rsquo;s extremely weak ARM processor wasn&rsquo;t quite cutting it.

          While I&rsquo;ve nuked my personal VPS, I still have a VPS that I use for work; it comes in handy for things like running cron jobs, maintaining persistent shells, and generally handling things where a Linux shell seems better than a macOS shell (I&rsquo;m looking at you, remote PowerShell sessions connecting to Microsoft Exchange.) This week I decided to upgrade it from Ubuntu 18.04 to Ubuntu 20.04. I like to stick on the LTS (long term support) releases for my servers, but I do typically prefer to keep even the LTS releases upgraded rather than waiting for them to go end of life.

          I wrote about a month ago of an update on my Pinebook Pro after switching to Manjaro Linux. I continue to make heavy use of my Pinebook Pro while I&rsquo;m still social distancing and staying at home, giving me lots of time to work on personal projects without much else to do.
Today I ran into an interesting issue, though, after applying a round of updates. I mentioned in my last Pinebook Pro post about going through the process of creating a swapfile using the directions from the Manjaro wiki so that I could hibernate the machine and get much better battery life.

          I had written in early February about my Pinebook Pro laptop after roughly a month of using it. Now that significantly more time has passed, time which I&rsquo;ve almost exclusively spent at home due to nationwide stay-at-home orders and social distancing, I figure I&rsquo;d share some of my thoughts on the laptop I raved about initially, and more specifically what I&rsquo;ve done with the operating system.
The OS If you read my original post then you may recall that I was debating swapping the default Debian operating system for something different.

          In my last post about not using Chrome OS, I neglected to get into what I was replacing my Chromebooks with since that seemed like a lengthy post in its own right. As the title gave away, my switch went to the Pinebook Pro from Pine 64. I had been interested in the original $99 USD Pinebook when that came out a couple of years ago, but it seemed a bit too basic for what I wnanted.

          Do you trust your Internet service provider? If you answer that question with a resounding “No!”, then you’re among friends here. While Internet connectivity is an essential need for many of us, there are a plethora of reasons to be wary of the company providing that connectivity to you. Especially in the United States, the recent repeal of net neutrality rules and erosion of privacy mean you may want to obscure exactly what you’re doing from your Internet provider, even if that activity is completely legal and innocuous.

          As we’ve mentioned in a few podcast episodes, I happen to be a fan of Chromebooks. I have a hulking desktop that I use for things like gaming, programming, and photo editing. That same desktop is also extremely loud and generates enough heat to warm my apartment, whether it needs to be warmed or not. As a result I tend to like having a cheap Chromebook handy when I just need to take care of some email, catch up on my RSS feeds, waste time look at memes on Reddit, or writing posts for our podcast.

          In Episode 11, I had discussed how I run a couple of my websites on a Linux server running Nginx as the web server and encrypting connections to them via Let’s Encrypt certificates. Shortly after recording that episode, though, I realized I had messed up my certificate configuration via certbot. If you don’t recall the episode, I had taken my web server which was only running laifu.moe and added awk.ninja to it so that I had both sites running on the same server.
