      <description>As I’ve mentioned before, I’m a pretty big fan of music. I link my Spotify account to Last.fm for all of the juicy statistics, and I feel like I’ve been a complete loser if my weekly report doesn’t have at least 24 hours of listening on it. One of the things I’ve never really done much of, though, is live music. I’ve wanted to start attending more events, though a bit of social anxiety can make that challenging (though it helps that many of the shows I’d want to go to are at bars… drinking making social anxiety more tolerable.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;As I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://unusually.pink/post/2018-wrapped/&#34;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, I’m a pretty big fan of music. I link my Spotify account to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.last.fm/user/johnfail&#34;&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; for all of the juicy statistics, and I feel like I’ve been a complete loser if my weekly report doesn’t have at least 24 hours of listening on it. One of the things I’ve never really done much of, though, is live music. I’ve wanted to start attending more events, though a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; of social anxiety can make that challenging (though it helps that many of the shows I’d want to go to are at bars… drinking making social anxiety more tolerable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final push, though, came a few weeks ago when I got an email from Spotify about an upcoming show. I’ve received a few of these emails before where Spotify finds upcoming shows (relatively) close to me and recommends them. While the other shows I’ve seen before weren’t particularly enticing, the most recent email was for a show by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theaccidentalsmusic.com/&#34;&gt;The Accidentals&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that they’ve been together for quite a long time, I never discovered them until late last year when a friend and I were trying to find a bunch of songs to add to our BlizzCon-themed playlist we were creating in preparation for our trip. I stumbled across their track &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRP4TquLg-U&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earthbound&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and immediately fell in love. Since then I’ve been through their entire library more times than I can count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend graciously agreed to go with me, so yesterday we got to experience The Accidentals live. The show was nothing short of incredible; I feel like I should’ve paid more for the tickets given how amazing the experience was. All three members of the band are such talented and passionate people, playing an insane variety of instruments and doing songs in a swath of different styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/TheAccidentalsShow_signal-2019-04-07-102809-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they didn’t perform &lt;em&gt;Earthbound&lt;/em&gt;, I was stoked for them to play both &lt;em&gt;Heavy Flag&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Crow’s Feet&lt;/em&gt;, along with a &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; acoustic version of &lt;em&gt;Sixth Street&lt;/em&gt; at the front of the stage. I also got to experience some brand new songs they’re trying out in preparation for the &lt;em&gt;TWO&lt;/em&gt; (!) albums they’re planning to release this year. The first will be a live album coming out in a few months, and the second later in the year will be a fully produced studio album. The show was definitely the high point of my 2019 thus far. Any music fans who happen to get the chance to see The Accidentals live should definitely jump at the opportunity and support some amazing live music.&lt;/p&gt;
