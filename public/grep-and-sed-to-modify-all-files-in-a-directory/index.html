        <p>I recently decided to rebrand one of my websites, complete with a different domain, title, and author (that’s me!) This is part of the beauty of using a static site generator like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>; I updated the domain in my configuration file, and everything else just magically changed when the site was recompiled. The caveat is that I wanted to change the <code>author</code> attribute in each post to a different name to match my <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@consoleaccess">new Mastodon profile</a>. In this particular <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-terminal/">Hugo theme</a> the author is specified in each post rather than in the central <code>config.toml</code> file so that I can have different authors in a single site. This meant I needed to mass modify all of my posts to change the author (at least for the ones that have it since I previously used a theme where the author wasn’t specified.) I knew that this should be possible with <code>sed</code> but couldn’t remember the exact syntax. Since Hugo stores all of the Markdown files for my posts in a single directory, though, I knew it shouldn’t be too complicated.</p>
<p>The syntax <code>sed</code> uses to do find-and-replace is <em>very</em> familiar to me since I use the same syntax in <code>vim</code> all the time. It’s great for those moments when I realize I’ve given a particular variable or function an extremely poor name and need to change every instance in a particular file. So what I really needed in this case was to recall how to use the CLI to change the value in multiple files; specifically I needed to change every file in a particular directory. It didn’t take many searches for me to confirm that this would require another utility to discover each file so that <code>sed</code> could then update them. Ultimately I got up and running with the following commands thanks to <a href="https://isaacsukin.com/news/2013/06/command-line-tip-replace-word-all-files-directory">what I found on this site</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">grep -lr -e <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;author = \&#34;oldName\&#34;&#34;</span> . | xargs sed -i <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;&#39;</span> -e <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;s/author = \&#34;oldName\&#34;/author = \&#34;consoleaccess\&#34;/g&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In this case, <code>grep</code> is discovering the files and then I’m using <code>xargs</code> to redirect the output from <code>grep</code> to the arguments for <code>sed</code>. I won’t rehash the specific parameters of each command, as the original site I linked to above does a terrific job of that. However, it’s worth mentioning that I was able to swap out <em>just</em> the instances of my old account name for the Markdown file’s <strong>author</strong> property by specifying the full line instead of just the account name; all I had to do was use the <code>\</code> to escape things like the double-quotes that I needed to include. This way everything runs as efficiently as possible since <code>grep</code> is only returning the files that contain the old name in the author property, and then <code>sed</code> is only changing that single line of each file passed to it.</p>
