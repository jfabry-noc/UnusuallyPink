        <p>Do you want to listen to the dankest collection of music since my <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/blog/2018-in-music-spotify-wrapped">2018 Spotify wrapped post</a>? If your answer is yes (and really… I don’t see a single possible reason why it shouldn’t be) then you’re in luck. We are pleased to introduce the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/26aNDr4SulSOQm1vEzUMpG"><strong>Unusually Pink Playlist</strong></a>. Featuring tracks loved by Brandi and I, most will be more recent discoveries as opposed to old favorites; we don’t really want to start off a brand new playlist with 10+ hours of material right out of the gate… even if it would be <em>really</em> good material.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Brandi and I have a lot in common when it comes to music, but we also a good bit of diversity and different methods of finding new music. We just start putting this playlist together the other day, but you’ll eventually start seeing plenty of indie, hip-hop, and EDM making the rounds along with some pop.</p>
<p>If you find yourself enjoying the playlist, feel free to give it a follow! Song recommendations are always welcome; hit us up on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/UnusuallyPink">@UnusuallyPink</a>.</p>
