        <p>I’ve used quite a few streaming services for music throughout the years (I feel old remembering when Pandora was new), but Spotify is by far my favorite. The main value I see from it as opposed to similar, competing services is the amount of personalized, curated content that Spotify generates for me on a regular basis. Each Monday I get a Discover Weekly playlist with music I’ve never listened to before but which is similar to other things I’ve enjoyed. Every Friday I get a Release Radar playlist with new releases that also match my taste. These only get better over time as the service learns more and more of what I like.</p>
<p>Along with these weekly goodies, Spotify also does neat stuff for various milestones, and that’s especially true at the end of the calendar year. For example, each December I get a yearly playlist with my top 100 songs from the past year. It’s always an interesting listen to see how varied my tastes were throughout the year. Accompanying that is <a href="https://spotifywrapped.com">Spotify Wrapped</a> which provides all sorts of interesting statistics about my listening. As someone who keeps Spotify tied to <a href="https://last.fm">Last.fm</a> because I love statistics, I always look forward to Wrapped. Here are some of my interesting notes from 2018 (no pun intended.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>8,131: The total number of unique songs I listened to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50,739: The total number of minutes I listened to music.</p>
<ul>
<li>For those keeping score at home, that’s over 35 <strong>days</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>My top artist was Tegan and Sara.</p>
<ul>
<li>I spent 32 hours listening just to their tracks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall top artists:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tegan and Sara</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eminem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coeur De Pirate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>St. Vincent</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall top tracks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>RAP DEVIL (Machine Gun Kelly)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Los Ageless (St. Vincent)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1940 - AmpLive Remix (The Submarines)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flesh without Blood (Grimes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do You Feel It? (Chaos Chaos)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall top genres:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Indie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dance/Electronic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hip Hop</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>I listened to “non-mainstream” artists 69% more than the average Spotify listener.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have no idea what’s considered mainstream or whether Spotify is taking the “average” listener to be all listeners or only Premium accounts. Regardless, it makes me feel special.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s to more music in 2019.</p>
