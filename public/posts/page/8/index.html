          One of my favorite aspects of Linux ever since my first Ubuntu 6.06 installation has been the software repository. Back in 2006, installing the overwhelming majority of the software I might need from a supported repository stood in stark contrast with the Windows XP method of searching the web for the software you wanted, finding a download link that didn&rsquo;t seem shady, and then hoping for the best.
Repositories are frequently hosted by the maintainer of a Linux distribution (e.

          As you may recall, I purchased a new Linux laptop from Star Labs a while back. It’s a solid little device, though I admittedly haven’t been using it as much as I anticipated due to my increased reliance on my iPads. For more information on that, look for the new Same Shade Of Difference podcast episode that should be dropping very soon. That being said, because I don’t have the worst operational security ever, I do update my laptop every time I happen to see that something is pending.

          Note: In the sample below, I&rsquo;m using Ubuntu Linux as the host for my web server. The instructions should be the same for other flavors of Linux, though the path to your Nginx sites configuration files may be different.
Generally when you navigate to a website, such as https://unusually.pink/, you don&rsquo;t actually get to see the files which live on the server at the location hosting all of the HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other goodies for the site.

          I feel like I start almost every post this way these days, but given the ongoing global pandemic, I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot more time at home doing things like staying on top of my reading. You&rsquo;d think I got paid by the COVID-19 reference if you were silly enough to think I get paid to write anything on this blog. Recently, though, I had a bit of an epiphany while catching up on my web-based reading.

          After I upgraded my macOS install from 11.1 to 11.2, the next time I tried running brew update to update all of the packages available in Homebrew, I got a wall of text regarding things going off the rails that ultimately culminated with this error:
 Error: Failure while executing; git config --replace-all homebrew.analyticsmessage true was terminated by uncaught signal KILL.
 When this happens, not only is Homebrew broken, but git itself is broken.

          I spend the majority of my computing time on the MacBook Pro that I use for work. For a very long time, I&rsquo;ve used Safari as my main browser on it. Unsurprisingly, Safari integrates very nicely with the rest of macOS, and I honestly just really like it as a browser. Lately, though, I&rsquo;ve been experiencing increased frustration with Safari and the web as a whole that has had me looking for alternatives.

          Anyone who knows me, reads the type of things I tweet about, and/or listens to the Same Shade of Difference podcast knows that I&rsquo;m an advocate of online privacy. I&rsquo;m all for blocking trackers, avoiding services from invasive companies like Facebook, and generally trying to keep as much of what I do online known only to me. That being said, while I typically configure my browser to block things like Google Analytics because Google is already a super creepy company that gathers an order of magnitude more data than it should about people, I also see the value in having analytics for a website.

          I&rsquo;ve written before about the fact that I use Groovy heavily in my current role since the platform I work the most frequently with is able to treat it as a first class citizen, whereas using something like PowerShell or Python adds a few more hurdles. The other thing I work with heavily is Office 365; this got me wondering if I might be able to combine the two by using Groovy to query Microsoft&rsquo;s Graph API.

          My Groovy posts always have the absolute worst titles, but I figure that making them verbose is really the only way to make them discoverable. I write a good bit of Groovy code at work, and given that it&rsquo;s been a few years since the heyday of Groovy it can occasionally be a bit of a struggle to figure out exactly what I need with the resources I dig up online.

          While I made the change a few weeks ago, it seems fitting that my first post of 2021 should be about my swap to the Twenty Twenty-One WordPress theme. For anyone who isn&rsquo;t aware, each year WordPress releases a new &ldquo;official&rdquo; theme for the platform. While theme-elitists out there may scoff at them in favor of paid, premium themes, I&rsquo;ve always found the yearly offerings to be elegant and well-designed. I had originally planned on putting this post together on January 1st, but what can I say&hellip; movies on HBO Now aren&rsquo;t going to binge-watch themselves.

          Continuing with the theme of reading books that spawned movies I thought were terrible but had interesting concepts, I recently read Bird Box. I watched the film for Bird Box back in 2018 shortly after it was released on Netflix, and I wasn&rsquo;t exactly fond of it. So much of the film just didn&rsquo;t seem to make any sense to me, but I really liked the concept of creatures that would create madness in someone simply by seeing them.

          At the end of each year I always look forward to my yearly music stats. I did a post back in 2018 with my Spotify Wrapped statistics, and Brandi and I did a podcast episode on our 2019 music stats. This year is a bit wonky since I used several different music services, but the most relevant metrics I got were from my 2020 Replay from Apple Music. Apple gives a few metrics after getting some flack for historically not providing anything like what Spotify does, but what they did share is at least interesting and worthy of comparison to previous years.

          After spending some quality time with my Pinebook Pro, I decided that I wanted something slightly more powerful for my personal laptop. While most of my heavy-lifting in the world of computers is done with my MacBook Pro for work (which was recently upgraded to a device featuring the new M1 chips; look for more on that soon both here and on the Same Shade of Difference podcast), the Pinebook Pro&rsquo;s extremely weak ARM processor wasn&rsquo;t quite cutting it.

          Between the Thanksgiving holiday and some shifting priorities when I got back to work, I hadn&rsquo;t made any new commits to my GitHub account for about 10 days. This meant that I didn&rsquo;t have any new posts to my recently-launched GitCommit site that makes a bit of a microblog from my commit messages. To be honest, putting it together was really an excuse to have something up at the domain I bought, but I really like the way it turned out.

          Nearly a year and a half ago, I went on a movie binge and watched The Silence. My consensus was that the movie itself was pretty poorly executed with nearly enough plot holes to make me overlook how interesting the overall premise of the story happened to be. I had written:
 Just like with Bird Box, I think the idea is interesting, but the execution of the film was just awful.

          Given that I have technological FOMO while also being a technology masochist, I upgraded my 2018 MacBook Pro to macOS 11 &ldquo;Big Sur&rdquo; as soon as it was available. Common sense dictates that I should have waited a while to let others encounter and fix some of the kinks prior to upgrading myself, but what&rsquo;s the fun in that? I admittedly had a very smooth experience without many issues, and I&rsquo;ve been happily on Big Sur for a few weeks now.

          A few weeks ago I received an email offering to let me try the premium variant of the RememBear password manager for a year for free. I assume that I received this since I currently have an active TunnelBear subscription that I use for my VPN. I didn&rsquo;t bother looking into things too closely, but my understanding is that you can normally use RememBear for free, but syncing your passwords between multiple devices requires a premium subscription&hellip; meaning that in 2020 when people have a phone, a tablet, and at least one computer, a premium subscription is basically a requirement.

Sometimes it would work fine, sometimes it would work only when pressed with an excessive amount of force no touch-typist could reliably muster (at which point the key would clank down awkwardly), and sometimes it just wouldn&rsquo;t work at all. Unsurprisingly, the letter O is one that I use with a good bit of regularly, so this presented a problem.

          For anyone who listens to the Same Shade of Difference podcast, you may have heard a brief discussion between Mark and I about how I had switched from Apple Music to Amazon Music. I&rsquo;ve previously been a fan of Spotify, though I became increasingly irritated with the focus they started giving podcasts rather than music. I know it&rsquo;s weird coming from someone who has spent the past couple of years creating podcasts, but I don&rsquo;t listen to them.

          Attack Surface is the latest novel by amazing author and journalist Cory Doctorow. Cory is one of those people with whom almost anyone interested in digital rights and online privacy is likely at least somewhat familiar. While I followed Cory on Twitter (back when I still used Twitter) from my early days on the platform and regularly read his content on Boing Boing, I never read any of his books until Craft Brew Geek convinced me (not that it took a lot of convincing) to read Little Brother and Homeland.

          It&rsquo;s no secret around this blog or for anyone who listened to the Unusually Pink Podcast that I&rsquo;m a fan of ProtonMail. While it&rsquo;s unfortunate that privacy in the world of computing often comes with an associated monetary cost, the simple fact of the matter is that if you aren&rsquo;t paying for your email account then chances are the provider is making money off of your data that happens to be stored in it.

          While I&rsquo;ve been stuck at home as the global coronavirus pandemic rages on (currently on day 241 of quarantine, for those who listen to the Same Shade Of Difference), I&rsquo;ve been trying to make the most of my time in captivity with lots of reading, training, and personal projects to learn as much new stuff as I can. One of the items that came on to my radar a few months ago was a new infosec book titled Hands On Hacking from Wiley.

          I recently decided to take a little bit of time to set up NextDNS. While on the surface it&rsquo;s similar to the myriad other DNS resolvers out there you can opt to use instead of the likely horrible DNS servers provided by your ISP, NextDNS is essentially a cloud-based Pi-hole. You can use some of the built-in blacklists in the product to block things like advertising, trackers, malware domains, and more.

          As someone who has been an apartment dweller for a relatively long time, there are some extremely solid perks to it. It&rsquo;s nice to never have to worry about things like maintenance, for example; if something goes wrong, I open a service ticket and someone shows up to fix the problem. When my furnace wouldn&rsquo;t start on a cold day, for example, I wasn&rsquo;t scrambling to figure out who to call.

          While I&rsquo;ve nuked my personal VPS, I still have a VPS that I use for work; it comes in handy for things like running cron jobs, maintaining persistent shells, and generally handling things where a Linux shell seems better than a macOS shell (I&rsquo;m looking at you, remote PowerShell sessions connecting to Microsoft Exchange.) This week I decided to upgrade it from Ubuntu 18.04 to Ubuntu 20.04. I like to stick on the LTS (long term support) releases for my servers, but I do typically prefer to keep even the LTS releases upgraded rather than waiting for them to go end of life.

          I&rsquo;ve written before about how difficult it can be to record podcasts remotely, something that has continued to be a struggle throughout the pandemic. For the Unusually Pink Podcast, the irritation of recording remotely was enough to make both Brandi and myself decide it was best to throw in the towel after a year. Mark and I have managed to continue doing well with the Same Shade Of Difference podcast, though significantly more work is involved in getting an episode together when done remotely.

          It&rsquo;s not too often these days that I find myself needing to update the underpinnings of PowerShell. The majority of the PowerShell work I do now is based on PowerShell Core, the current version of which is 7.0.3, and frequently just comes with newer versions of the supporting modules. PowerShell Core began with PowerShell 6 and is created with .NET Core, which is Microsoft&rsquo;s open source and cross-platform flavor of .

          Last week the 10.15.7 update to macOS Catalina came with a nice surprise: Safari 14. I was caught off guard by this since I had assumed we wouldn&rsquo;t see Safari 14 until Big Sur released later this year. It was also a nice surprise for me since Safari has become my browser of choice, not just on my iPhone and iPad, but also on my MacBook Pro. The big reason for this is that I do my best to avoid any Chromium-based browser.

          As a follow-up to my last post on GitHub Pages, I mentioned that I moved one of my websites to Firebase. Firebase is a platform from Google for creating web and mobile applications. As a PaaS offering, there are a lot of different parts to the service, but as a platform for web applications hosting is naturally one of them. The free Spark plan offers 10 GB of storage, 360 MB of data transfer per day (which works out to 10 GB of bandwidth per month), and support for custom domains and SSL.

          As I had mentioned in my post about Dropbox Passwords, I&rsquo;m looking to cut down on the number of services that I pay for each month. One of the areas I&rsquo;ve decided to cut down on are my domains; I&rsquo;m letting a few domains that I never ended up finding much of a use for expire rather than having them automatically renew. Some have been renewing like this for years just because I didn&rsquo;t want to lose them for some reason despite never having any real use for them.

          I wrote previously about moving this blog from Squarespace to WordPress. One of my cited concerns with Squarespace was being locked into that particular platform without a lot of options for moving somewhere else. So how did I move my content to WordPress? I was able to export the written content for the posts themselves from within Squarespace, fortunately. Inside of Settings &gt; Advanced is an Import / Export option. The only export offering is WordPress, so I guess it was lucky that&rsquo;s where I was moving.

          I tend to pay for a lot of subscription services. In fact, my friend Mark and I have enough of them between us that we needed not one but two episodes of our podcast just to talk about all of our subscriptions. Since the pandemic means I have nothing better to do with my time than sit around and think about things like how much money I spend on subscriptions, though, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about which ones I might be able to do without, which ones I could swap for cheaper services, etc.

          So Long, Squarespace! If anyone stumbles across this site who was previously an Unusually Pink reader, then you might notice that the site looks a bit different after a few months of hiatus. In the short, just under 2 year lifespan of the site it has now moved to its 3rd host. Originally it was hosted on a Vultr VPS that I had been hosting a few other things on, back when I originally bought the domain because I loved the name but had no idea what to do with it.

          The Others I’ve struggled for years with finding a good, reliable, and simple note-taking application that fit my needs and didn’t lock me in to a particular platform. When I started my career, I was using Evernote for handling my notes at work. At the time, the free version of Evernote was pretty solid which was good because I didn’t have the money to be spending on notes. After a few years, however, Evernote apparently decided that not enough people were paying for the premium version of the product; as a result they crippled the free version.

          There&rsquo;s a saying among system administrators:
 It&rsquo;s always DNS.
 Meaning that whenever there’s an issue, DNS is likely the culprit. This morning that adage proved itself yet again.
My home network is currently running off of a Cradlepoint router. Cradlepoint’s specialty is making routers that can leverage LTE, so my router is configured to use my home ISP as the primary WAN link, but it will fail over to a cellular connection if my home ISP is unavailable.

I was doing this to see how to best handle the formatting for a script I was working on to periodically check my blog and link to any new posts from Mastodon. My friend tomasino who I’ve known for quite a while through SDF reached out to ask if there was an RSS feed for it.

          In my last post, I more or less just complained about what a dumpster fire developing anything for Twitter is. Originally, though, the post was intended to be about what I was developing for Twitter. It’s nothing amazing or even complicated, but it was a fun learning experience… Twitter itself not withstanding. I made a Twitter bot tweeting different shades of pink each day. Since that’ll most likely seem nonsensical to most people, let me explain.

          I recently had an idea to turn the Twitter account for my defunct podcast into a Twitter bot posting a new shade of pink every day; it makes sense because the podcast and Twitter account were centered around the color pink. I didn’t really think anyone would care about this particular bot, but it seemed like a fun project idea to work on. It ended up being an interesting learning experience, but not at all for the reasons I actually expected.

          I recently decided to rebrand one of my websites, complete with a different domain, title, and author (that’s me!) This is part of the beauty of using a static site generator like Hugo; I updated the domain in my configuration file, and everything else just magically changed when the site was recompiled. The caveat is that I wanted to change the author attribute in each post to a different name to match my new Mastodon profile.

          Are you tired of sitting at home wondering how many days you’ve been choosing to quarantine like a responsible adult? Me too! The number of times I’ve been in conversations or working on posts for blogs or social media and thought, “Wait, how long have I been at home now?” followed by wasting time doing rough calendar math in my head was enough that I finally burned some time this weekend putting together a script for it.

          Management of one of my blogs is handled through a variety of shell scripts. I have a script for executing hugo to rebuild the site and copy the output of the public directory to the folder where Nginx hosts it, for example. One of my scripts creates a tarball of the site and uses rsync to copy it to another server so that, if my VPS blows up, I can easily retrieve the backup.

          I caused a little bit of chaos for myself the other night when I updated one of my websites. The site is a static, single page that I use for work-related bookmarks; it&rsquo;s basically a site I stood up to have something at a domain I wanted to buy. While making a couple of changes to the links, I decided to update the background image. That was a little bit gross to do since the site was originally compiled with Hugo, but after the initial setup I just modified the HTML directly.

          As a follow-up to my post on creating a JWT in Groovy, I did manage to figure out how to make an HttpClient in Groovy as opposed to making raw connections. You can see this implemented in the GitHub repository I used for the previously linked post. It was honestly pretty easy to do, and there are tons of tutorials out there; the code is essentially the same regardless of whether you&rsquo;re doing it in Java, Kotlin, or Groovy.

          On Friday I found myself in a new situation. I was working with APIs for a new service my company has started using, but their setup was a bit more involved than what I&rsquo;ve typically experienced. Accessing many services via their REST API requires you to follow a few steps to generate an application ID and an API key, you pass those with your request, and you&rsquo;re done. The downside to this is that it can open up security vulnerabilities; if something happens to your API keys, for example, they can be used for nefarious purposes.

One of the things I decided to work on was creating a Mastodon client. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with Mastodon, it&rsquo;s a social network most likened to Twitter.

          Lately I&rsquo;ve been working through the very arduous (for me) process of learning Go for some personal projects. I selected Go because I typically use interpretted, dynamically typed languages for work, so I thought it would be a good learning experience to work with a compiled, statically typed language. To me at least, Go seemed a bit more approachable than something like C or Rust. I started trying to learn Kotlin since I&rsquo;ve been working with another JVM-based language in Groovy, but it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to use Kotlin from just the command line without an IDE; when I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to add an external package to a project without an IDE I basically gave up on it since it didn&rsquo;t fit at all into my workflow.

          Earlier this week a friend reached out to me regarding a website. He had just finished developing his very first iOS game and was ready to submit it to Apple for approval. One of Apple&rsquo;s myriad requirements, though, is a website containing the author&rsquo;s privacy policy. My friend had no website and no idea how to make one, so he asked me if I could help. It seems wild to me that someone could have the chops to make an iOS app in Objective-C or Swift but not be able to make a website, but each of us has a different skill set.

          Yesterday was the keynote for Apple&rsquo;s 2020 Worldwide Developer Conference. Like so many things right now, the entire conference, keynote included, is virtual due to the coronavirus pandemic. In this case, it&rsquo;s a blessing for the sessions since it means they&rsquo;re all free for anyone to stream as opposed to being a $1500+ USD ticket. Admittedly, though, the keynote left something to be desired. Just a few weeks ago at Microsoft Build, I feel like Microsoft crushed it with their keynote.

          I wrote about a month ago of an update on my Pinebook Pro after switching to Manjaro Linux. I continue to make heavy use of my Pinebook Pro while I&rsquo;m still social distancing and staying at home, giving me lots of time to work on personal projects without much else to do.
Today I ran into an interesting issue, though, after applying a round of updates. I mentioned in my last Pinebook Pro post about going through the process of creating a swapfile using the directions from the Manjaro wiki so that I could hibernate the machine and get much better battery life.

          I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that the title of this post is a bit too verbose, but if someone else had a post online with a title like this it could&rsquo;ve potentially saved me a lot of time. Here&rsquo;s to hoping it helps someone else in their search.
As is mentioned on my personal website, I do a lot of PowerShell and Python scripting for work. Recently, though, I started working in Groovy due to the fact that it&rsquo;s treated as a first-class language in a system I&rsquo;ve been integrating SaaS applications into.

          I had written in early February about my Pinebook Pro laptop after roughly a month of using it. Now that significantly more time has passed, time which I&rsquo;ve almost exclusively spent at home due to nationwide stay-at-home orders and social distancing, I figure I&rsquo;d share some of my thoughts on the laptop I raved about initially, and more specifically what I&rsquo;ve done with the operating system.
The OS If you read my original post then you may recall that I was debating swapping the default Debian operating system for something different.

          Background Last week I received a bit of a mystifying alert from Office 365 letting me know that our pool of PSTN dial-out minutes for the month had been 80% consumed. This was mystifying due to the fact that as someone who has managed O365 for nearly a decade I didn&rsquo;t realize there was a pool of minutes. PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) had to be related in some way or another to the capability my company has purchased from Office 365 to have a dial-in option added to our Microsoft Teams meetings.

          As we mentioned in our last episode, we&rsquo;ve switched to recording our podcast episodes remotely due to the fact that there&rsquo;s currently a global pandemic happening. It&rsquo;s been a big change considering that every other episode of both this podcast and the Same Shade of Difference podcast have been recorded in person.
Switching to a remote recording setup has been trying since, to be completely honest, most of the services for remote podcasting are horrible.

          Over a month ago now at the beginning of March, Craft Brew Geek and I had the opportunity to attend the Podfest Multimedia Expo, the largest indie podcast conference in the world. While it was a bit of a scary experience to travel and attend when the coronavirus was just starting to make waves in the United States (which wasn&rsquo;t aided by an over 4 hour delay at the airport for our flight back home), it was still a great conference even if it was plagued by a poor venue and questionable organization.

          A couple of days ago Brandi decided to try streaming her latest obsession, Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Twitch. As the unofficial game of the coronavirus quarantine, it seemed like a good idea. When she told me, I decided to do the comfortable thing and turn on her stream from the Twitch app on my Amazon Fire TV Stick so I could watch it on my TV. This works well for most of the streams I might happen to watch because I never actually care about interacting with the chat.

          The coronavirus has been causing havoc for industries across the globe, including the music industry. Especially for small, indie artists, the revenue they make from doing live shows is vital for their ability to continue doing what they love. In the case of a global pandemic, though, all of those shows have been canceled, leaving artists struggling to make it by.
Having been social distancing/self quarantining for about two weeks now, I&rsquo;ve been doing my best to live by the very wise, meaningful words of Craft Brew Geek when he told a group of us:

          Full Disclosure: This won&rsquo;t tell you exactly what was wrong with a website. This will just give you a pretty good, quick idea. I&rsquo;m not in DFIR or even InfoSec. I&rsquo;m just a sysadmin who has some familiarity with a decent number of systems. It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that I did all of these actions from my Linux machine. The same would be possible from macOS or from Windows 10 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

          As you likely know if you listen to the podcast, about 6 months ago I started a new job, and about 3 months ago I moved to be closer to that job. With Brandi&rsquo;s help, I managed to get moved without too much hassle, but I cut a few corners in getting my new home set up. One of those corners was my home network; after using the &ldquo;kit&rdquo; from my ISP to get my Internet service activated I had never bothered to swap out their equipment with my own.

          Having switched to a MacBook Pro for work when I started a new job about 6 months ago, I&rsquo;ve been on an interesting journey in finding new software to fit my workflow after over a decade of operating primarily on Windows for my professional computing. Given that I&rsquo;ve used Linux for years at a personal level, I can typically do anything I need on macOS by opening a Terminal; it&rsquo;s only when I&rsquo;ve got to operate at the graphical level that I can get a little tripped up by the differences between macOS and Windows.

          In my last post about not using Chrome OS, I neglected to get into what I was replacing my Chromebooks with since that seemed like a lengthy post in its own right. As the title gave away, my switch went to the Pinebook Pro from Pine 64. I had been interested in the original $99 USD Pinebook when that came out a couple of years ago, but it seemed a bit too basic for what I wnanted.

          If you’ve listened to some of our episodes or read some of my other posts on this site, then you’re likely aware that I’ve historically been a Chromebook fan. I started with the original HP Chromebook 11 and have owned quite a Chromebook collection since then. The speed and simplicity to do the two main things I need in my personal life (interacting with web pages and making SSH connections) coupled with the low cost made them a perfect match.

          Back in 2002, Firefox was the new hotness in the world of web browsers. Rising from the ashes of Netscape Navigator, the browser emerged as a true competitor to the horror of Internet Explorer. It offered competition with superior rendering and web compliance without the plethora of security issues plaguing Internet Explorer. While Firefox grew in popularity against Internet Explorer through the mid-2000’s, it eventually started to decline in the face of Google’s Chrome browser which took the browser market by storm with its release in the latter half of 2008.

          Brandi and I both love ProtonMail; we like it so much that it got the honor of being a topic in our very first episode! The biggest draws for paying for a ProtonMail Plus account are:
  Support for a custom domain (e.g. @unusually.pink)
  5 GB of storage (up from 500 MB)
  5 email aliases
  The ability to send up to 1000 messages per day (up from 150)

          If you’re a dedicated fan (or just, like, really bored all the time) you may recall that I talked about the upcoming release of the Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL back in the spring. I eventually decided to pull the trigger on a Pixel 3a XL in the summer during a 4th of July sale, but I’ve been hesitant to do any sort of write-up with my thoughts on the device just because they’ve been changing over time.

          Do you trust your Internet service provider? If you answer that question with a resounding “No!”, then you’re among friends here. While Internet connectivity is an essential need for many of us, there are a plethora of reasons to be wary of the company providing that connectivity to you. Especially in the United States, the recent repeal of net neutrality rules and erosion of privacy mean you may want to obscure exactly what you’re doing from your Internet provider, even if that activity is completely legal and innocuous.

          As we’ve mentioned in a few podcast episodes, I happen to be a fan of Chromebooks. I have a hulking desktop that I use for things like gaming, programming, and photo editing. That same desktop is also extremely loud and generates enough heat to warm my apartment, whether it needs to be warmed or not. As a result I tend to like having a cheap Chromebook handy when I just need to take care of some email, catch up on my RSS feeds, waste time look at memes on Reddit, or writing posts for our podcast.

          In Episode 11, I had discussed how I run a couple of my websites on a Linux server running Nginx as the web server and encrypting connections to them via Let’s Encrypt certificates. Shortly after recording that episode, though, I realized I had messed up my certificate configuration via certbot. If you don’t recall the episode, I had taken my web server which was only running laifu.moe and added awk.ninja to it so that I had both sites running on the same server.

          I had written back before this site was even on Squarespace about binging movies while I was sick since I don’t normally have the attention span to feel like I’m doing a movie justice; I’m too busy being a millenial who needs to check his phone at least once every 45 seconds. On a somewhat related note, I just got a new phone (look for a post on that in the near future), and I’m not so sure about this whole Digital Wellbeing thing.

          As we mentioned back in Episode 6, I had installed Pop!OS on my desktop. The design of the Pop!_OS interface is very streamlined and minimal to allow you to focus on things without as many distractions as you’ll frequently see in competing operating systems. That’s pretty awesome, but sometimes I want distractions… namely the ones I get by seeing which applications I have up and running in the background. As you’re probably used to seeing, applications like Dropbox and Discord will drop a small icon somewhere in your OS to let you know the applications are running.

          I was recently attempting to sort a list of IP addresses that I had in a text file. PowerShell is awesome at sorting, so I figured I would use it given that I had nearly 2000 of them. I initially just tried to pipe the contents of the file to the Sort-Object cmdlet:
Get-Content -Path .\ipListFixed.txt | Sort-Object
The results were, suffice to say, lackluster. I ended up with something like this:

          This will be one of those weird amalgam posts featuring multiple only mildly-related topics but which are too short to be a post in their own right. I though it would be helpful to provide some updates on a few things that Brandi and I have talked about in some of our past episodes. They’re all tech-related… but you already know that from reading the title.

          A friend of mine who has been doing some programming (hi, Fy!) recently asked me for some ideas on open source projects they could look at and possibly contribute to. It made me think of what open source software I tend to use on a regular basis… which is a decent amount as someone who runs a few different Linux systems. It seemed like a solid opportunity to compile the Super Official List of Open Source Stuff John Likes™.

          As we mentioned in our last episode, we recently got our podcast all over the Internet so you can listen to it regardless of which service(s) you happen to prefer.
Our host for the podcast is Podbean. The posts on the podcast page for each episode will always link to our Unusually Pink Podcast profile there. (Related: we are crushing it on the alliteration front.) We figured most people wouldn’t be listening to it directly from there, though.

          If you happened to listen to our Introduction Episode of the podcast, you’ll know that Brandi and I are sysadmins who work together in a highly Microsoft-centric environment. Essentially all of the servers we manage run some flavor of Windows, we make heavy use of Office 365 and Azure, and both of us spend our entire day either typing email into Outlook or commands into PowerShell.
You may read that and think, “Wow, they really like Microsoft stuff.

          Do you want to listen to the dankest collection of music since my 2018 Spotify wrapped post? If your answer is yes (and really… I don’t see a single possible reason why it shouldn’t be) then you’re in luck. We are pleased to introduce the Unusually Pink Playlist. Featuring tracks loved by Brandi and I, most will be more recent discoveries as opposed to old favorites; we don’t really want to start off a brand new playlist with 10+ hours of material right out of the gate… even if it would be really good material.

          If you happened to see this site around the time when the first post went up, you might notice that:
  The site looks very different now.
  A lot of what’s in that first post no longer seems to be true.
  For example, this is not the Rusty theme for Hugo. Those technically savvy would also notice that the site no longer has the same DNS record value as laifu.

          I’ve used quite a few streaming services for music throughout the years (I feel old remembering when Pandora was new), but Spotify is by far my favorite. The main value I see from it as opposed to similar, competing services is the amount of personalized, curated content that Spotify generates for me on a regular basis. Each Monday I get a Discover Weekly playlist with music I’ve never listened to before but which is similar to other things I’ve enjoyed.

          One of my websites (not this one) is hosted via Firebase. It’s a largely static site that I rarely need to touch. I manage it from their CLI running on a VPS that I do some coding on so that I can access it regardless of which of my numerous devices I happen to be using. Since I don’t touch the site regularly, though, the Firebase tools tend to get a bit out of date.

          I’ve been sick for the past week, and with a long weekend this past weekend I did what any sane sick person should do during cold weather: bundled up on the couch with blankets, a lot of tea, and watched movies. I’m usually too lazy to pay attention to a full movie, but given that I was camped out on the couch for entire days on end with a throbbing sinus headache, keeping track of the plot of a 2 hour movie was easier than keeping track of the plot for multiple television episodes.

          This domain was a completely random purchase. Earlier today while taking a break from work (which was sorely needed… I had 3 weeks off over the holidays, and coming back today was not easy), I decided to hop on Mastodon for the first time in quite a while. A friend of mine who was previously on the same instance as me had apparently swapped to a different instance during the month or so that I was gone.

          If you’re using Let’s Encrypt, now would be a really great time to make sure that you’re ready for them to stop supporting ACME TLS-SNI-01 domain validation. I got an email a couple of days ago (as I assume everyone using Let’s Encrypt did) letting me know this change was coming. I had nothing to actually do, but going through the validation was super easy and is likely worth the time to ensure your site(s) aren’t impacted.

          As I’ve mentioned before, I’m a pretty big fan of music. I link my Spotify account to Last.fm for all of the juicy statistics, and I feel like I’ve been a complete loser if my weekly report doesn’t have at least 24 hours of listening on it. One of the things I’ve never really done much of, though, is live music. I’ve wanted to start attending more events, though a bit of social anxiety can make that challenging (though it helps that many of the shows I’d want to go to are at bars… drinking making social anxiety more tolerable.

          Given the name of this site and what I said in the first post, you can probably guess that I’m a fan of things which are unusually pink. That’s why last year when gaming peripheral maker Razer announced a line of pink products under their new Quartz branding, I was stoked. I immediately ordered both their keyboard and their mouse. The Quartz products generally aren’t brand new; they’re a pink take on existing products.

          When you spend a significant portion of each and every day staring at a computer screen, it&rsquo;s important for things to look nice. Aside from just aesthetics, it can help reduce eye strain and improve productivity. With that in mind, we wanted to help spread the word about one of the best themes ever created: Dracula. I believe I first learned about the Dracula theme from someone I follow on Twitter, though enough time is passed that I&rsquo;m not 100% positive on who or if that&rsquo;s even where I really found it.
