        <p>Brandi and I both love <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a>; we like it so much that it got the honor of being a topic in our <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/podcast/episode-1-game-of-thrones-and-protonmail">very first episode</a>! The biggest draws for paying for a ProtonMail Plus account are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Support for a custom domain (e.g. @unusually.pink)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 GB of storage (up from 500 MB)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 email aliases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to send up to 1000 messages per day (up from 150)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of those are really nice perks! I have 3 different email aliases, one of which comes from a custom domain I added to the account. I don’t <em>personally</em> use a lot of storage… for now. I do my best to keep my inbox empty. Note that I said “inbox”, though, rather than “mailbox.” I do have an archive folder where I throw messages that contain something important that might be useful later… though I’ve been trying my best to stop storing things like that in email and storing them in <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/podcast/episode-8-playlists-and-privacy">1Password</a> instead.</p>
<p>While I have plenty of real-estate left in my inbox, last week ProtonMail made it even more difficult for me to start bumping my head against the storage limit; they gave me additional storage for free! In an email with a subject of “We&rsquo;re giving you extra storage to say thanks”, they described how they’ve added 10 <strong>million</strong> users to the service over the past year, and how they’re working on a redesigned ProtonMail interface while also continuing to flesh out ProtonCalendar and ProtonDrive, none of which would have been possible without the support of paid accounts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a way to say thanks for your early support, we are giving everyone with an existing paid plan 5GB of extra storage for free. […] Because the bonus is to thank our longtime supporters, it only applies to users who upgraded before Nov. 10, 2019. This bonus storage upgrade is permanent as long as you continue your subscription with us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, this is super awesome. I like being able to support a service like ProtonMail, a service that I’ve come to rely on for my personal email. I’m also eagerly awaiting the arrival of ProtonCalendar and (especially) ProtonDrive, so it’s nice to see that my payments are helping to facilitate the creation of those services, too. While I don’t particularly need the 5 GB of storage right now, it could certainly come in handy later on down the road, especially considering I have no plans on letting my service lapse. I checked out the billing on my account and verified that it was added as a line item to my subscription for a $0 charge.</p>
<p>Also, if you happen to be looking forward to the redesign of ProtonMail, I recently realized you can check it out over at: <a href="https://beta.protonmail.com">beta.protonmail.com</a></p>
<p>The new interface is pretty slick, in my opinion, and I’m excited to see what other great things the future has in store for the service. Keep on encrypting, and stay pink!</p>
