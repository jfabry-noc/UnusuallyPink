        <p>This will be one of those weird amalgam posts featuring multiple only mildly-related topics but which are too short to be a post in their own right. I though it would be helpful to provide some updates on a few things that Brandi and I have talked about in some of our <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/podcast">past episodes</a>. They’re all tech-related… but you already know that from reading the title.</p>
<h2 id="dropbox-upgrades-and-price-increases">Dropbox Upgrades and Price Increases<a href="#dropbox-upgrades-and-price-increases" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>On June 1st, Dropbox added more features to their <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/individual/plans-comparison">Plus plan</a>. I’ve been a Plus customer for a couple of years now. It’s less of a “I need to pay for the extra space” situation and more of a “I store some important shit in here and this gives me more peace of mind” situation. The main features from the upgrade, according to the email they sent me, are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Double your storage—save everything with 2 TB (2,000 GB).<br>
World-class sync technology—move out-of-date files off your computer’s hard drive and to the cloud with Dropbox Smart Sync.<br>
Dropbox Rewind—roll back accidental changes to any folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The extra storage is nice, though suffice to say it’s not exactly something I <strong>need</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/UnusuallyPinkUpdatesDropboxPasswordManagersandAdBlocking_dropbox_space.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Rewind seems <strong>really</strong> nice, though. I store a lot of PowerShell scripts in Dropbox, so I could see rewind being useful if I accidentally break one or need to snag an older version for some reason. While I’ve recently been making an effort to check in my bigger, more important scripts with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a> for version control, smaller ones that I’m the only person likely to use still just go into Dropbox.</p>
<p>Things aren’t all roses and unicorns, though, as the added storage and features come at a cost: $2 USD more per month. This bumps the monthly price up to $12 USD. The good part is that if you go with yearly pricing, you save that $2 a month and pay $120 for the year. I’m actually still on monthly pricing despite having used the Plus service for a few years so I’ll need to move over for sure. While the bonus storage is available now the new pricing isn’t happening for me until July. So before early July I need to swap to yearly billing to avoid paying the extra couple of bucks.</p>
<h2 id="wired-password-manager-recommendations">Wired Password Manager Recommendations<a href="#wired-password-manager-recommendations" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/podcast/episode-8-playlists-and-privacy">last episode</a>, Brandi and I spoke a bit about password managers. Right after we recorded that episode <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-password-managers/">Wired published an article all about password managers</a>. The timing seemed perfect to share it. Of the ones Wired recommends Dashlane is the only that I haven’t used. It also makes me feel good that my preferred password manager, <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, was Wired’s #1 recommendation.</p>
<p>Speaking of Wired, I love their content but always run into my 5 free articles per month limit. I just happened to see earlier today that they’re <a href="https://subscribe.wired.com/subscribe/wired/121031?source=EDT_WIR_TWITTER_0_WEEKOFJUNE03_3_ZZ&amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wired">doing a deal</a> where you can snag a year’s subscription for just $10. This includes the print editions plus digital content (normally $50 a year) or just digital if you don’t care about print (normally $30 a year.) I was fortunate enough to see it right when <a href="https://twitter.com/WIRED/status/1136709547022848006">they posted to Twitter</a>. I have no clue how long this is running for, but it seems pretty worthwhile if you’re a geek and like tech news. And no… we don’t get anything for promoting this. I just like Wired.</p>
<h2 id="browser-ad-blocking">Browser Ad Blocking<a href="#browser-ad-blocking" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Also from our <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/podcast/episode-8-playlists-and-privacy">last episode</a>, we discussed how <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-chrome-could-soon-kill-off-most-ad-blocker-extensions/">Google was initially thinking about making changes to the webRequest API</a> that would essentially cripple ad blockers. Like we discussed in the episode, after those initial reports and backlash in January Google had backed off a little and said they would think through how this API update should work. At the end of May, though, it came to light that <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/05/29/google-still-plans-to-kill-chromes-existing-adblock-apis/">Google still plans to nuke the webRequest API pieces that allow current ad blockers to work</a>… that is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/29/chrome-ad-blocking-enterprise-manifest-v3/">unless you’re a G Suite customer</a>.</p>
<p>What’s worse is that these proposed changes seem to be in the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/">open-source Chromium project</a>. So unless Microsoft does some work on their fork, the <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/">Chromium-based version of Edge</a> could also be impacted. Suffice to say this gives me some <strong>significant</strong> pause on my previously mentioned plans to buy a new Chromebook. I’m now re-evaluating what I should do for my laptop situation. And if you haven’t used <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox Quantum</a> recently, now might be a great time to check it out.</p>
