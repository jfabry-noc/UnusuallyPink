        <p>I had <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/blog/unusually-pink-impressions-pinebook-pro">written in early February about my Pinebook Pro laptop</a> after roughly a month of using it. Now that significantly more time has passed, time which I&rsquo;ve almost exclusively spent at home due to nationwide stay-at-home orders and social distancing, I figure I&rsquo;d share some of my thoughts on the laptop I raved about initially, and more specifically what I&rsquo;ve done with the operating system.</p>
<h2 id="the-os">The OS<a href="#the-os" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>If you read my original post then you may recall that I was debating swapping the default Debian operating system for something different. While I mentioned NetBSD in the post I ended up installing <a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro Linux</a> instead. Why? There are a few reasons to consider.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons why swapping the OS can be considered important is that there are some issues with the Debian build that came on my device. It&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/mrfixit2001/debian_desktop">custom setup put together by a community member</a>. It looks incredible, but that comes at a cost; the highly customized environment means that many things in it <em>cannot</em> be updated; this includes both Chromium and Firefox. Running outdated browsers isn&rsquo;t exactly cool, and I wasn&rsquo;t too keen on having to compile Firefox from source every time there was a new release.</p>
<p>On the other hand many of the community members seemed to really love Manjaro Linux, so I figured I&rsquo;d gvie it a shot. Along with people in the Pinebook community raving about it, it&rsquo;s also been hovering near the top of <a href="https://distrowatch.com/">Distrowatch</a> for a while now. In fact it was <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2020/03/15/march-update-manjaro-on-pinebook-pro-pinephone-software/">announced in March</a> that Manjaro was going to be the default OS for new Pinebook Pro devices, which is pretty slick! They&rsquo;re shipping with the KDE variant, though, and while I&rsquo;ve read about people having a good experience with that, I personaly prefer the more lightweight <a href="https://www.xfce.org/">XFCE desktop</a>. It&rsquo;s lighter, simpler, and overall I feel like it&rsquo;s a better fit for the Pinebook Pro.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-os">Getting The OS<a href="#getting-the-os" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>As something of a noob when it comes to working with open source SoC setups like a Rock64 or Raspberry Pi, I struggled a little with figuring out exactly how to install a new OS on the Pinebook Pro. The first thing I figured out is that, currently, you cannot boot the Pinebook Pro from USB. I made a few bootable flash drives like I would&rsquo;ve historically used when installing Linux on a more traditional device without success. The <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Pinebook_Pro">Pinebook Pro wiki</a> seems to contradict itself on this point, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pinebook Pro is capable of booting from eMMC, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, or an SD card. It cannot boot from USB-C. The boot order of the hard-coded ROM of its RK3399 SoC is: SPI NOR, eMMC, SD, USB OTG.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then in the very next paragraph it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this time, the Pinebook Pro ships with a Debian + MATE build with uboot on the eMMC. Its boot order is: SD, then eMMC. Booting off USB storage is not currently available, but will be in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past myself to just be misunderstanding something, though, so your mileage may vary. As you might be able to guess from the quotes shared above, I just ordred a cheap microSD card online and used that for the OS installation; everything worked great.</p>
<p>For Manjaro specifically, the best way to get the proper image is to go to the forum announcement for the latest version, like <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-arm-20-04-released/133374">this one for the 20.04 release</a>. There you can select the appropriate link for your Pinebook Pro and for your preferred desktop environment. Once you select that, you&rsquo;ll be taken to another page <a href="https://osdn.net/projects/manjaro-arm/storage/pbpro/xfce/20.04/">like this one listing all of the images files you can download for that version and desktop environment</a>.</p>
<p>Be aware that if you want to install Manjaro <strong>directly on the laptop</strong>, be sure to grab the image file with &ldquo;emmc-installer&rdquo; in the file name! This is the image designed to be flashed onto the internal eMMC storage of the Pinebook Pro! Grabbing the image without this will simply create a microSD card that will run the OS. This isn&rsquo;t bad if you&rsquo;d like to try out Manjaro while leaving the Debian installation on your eMMC, but I wanted to go all-in.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-your-media">Preparing Your Media<a href="#preparing-your-media" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>To prepare the media, you can use basically any option that&rsquo;ll allow you to flash the .img file you downloaded onto the microSD card. You can be old-school and use <code>dd</code> from the command line, but I went easy mode and used <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">balenaEtcher</a> instead.</p>
<h2 id="the-rest">The Rest<a href="#the-rest" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The boot order on the Pinebook Pro automatically has the microSD card slot above the eMMC, so once you have a microSD card prepared just insert it into the Pinebook Pro, boot the device, and follow the prompts; it&rsquo;s honestly pretty simple to install. The only catch is a known bug with the 20.04 release where you have to hit <code>Esc</code> while looking at the Manjaro logo after booting from the microSD card before it&rsquo;ll move forward; as a known bug I would imagine this won&rsquo;t be relevant for future releases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the Manjaro logo has been present for about 15 seconds, press ESC (this is a bug, we know).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once it&rsquo;s all done, you boot to this gorgeous view!</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats<a href="#caveats" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>For the most part, Manjaro works like a complete dream, and I&rsquo;ve been extremely happy with it. There are just a couple of caveats that might be worth mentioning, though.</p>
<h3 id="initial-update">Initial Update<a href="#initial-update" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>First, there was a bug when running the initial software update on the factory image. First I had to figure out <em>how</em> to update it, but after some quick DuckDuckGo-fu (since I&rsquo;ve really only used Debian-based flavors of Linux before) I figured I could update Manjaro via:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">sudo pacman -Syyu
</code></pre></div><p>Note that you can aslo just click the little shield icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Regardless of method, though, immediately after booting my new OS I would get the following error when attempting to update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conflicting files: nss /usr/lib/p11-kit-trust.so already exists in filesystem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another benefit to choosing Manjaro is that it has an extremely active community, so it&rsquo;s easy to search on errors like this and get solutions! I quickly found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NexyTfO0iuY">YouTube video</a> covering this error and providing the solution:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">sudo pacman -Syyu --overwrite /usr/lib*/p11-kit-trust.so
</code></pre></div><p>After that initial update succeeded I&rsquo;ve been able to perform subsequent updates without needing the <code>--overwrite</code> parameter. Updating via the GUI also works.</p>
<h3 id="swap">Swap<a href="#swap" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s entirely possible I just made a mistake in my installation, but I eventually realized that I didn&rsquo;t have a swap partition or file. I realized this because I noticed that the battery drain while under suspend was a bit severe; I was losing roughly 6% of my battery per hour. This meant that leaving the device on suspend for a day would completely drain a full battery. I changed my XFCE setting so that when closing the lid of the device it would hibernate. This gave me an error, though, that I didn&rsquo;t have enough swap space to hibernate.</p>
<p>I checked the output of <code>htop</code> and realized that I didn&rsquo;t have enough space because I didn&rsquo;t have <strong>any</strong> swap. Luckily for me, the Manjaro folks have a wiki page dedicated to exactly this; I ended up following the steps to <a href="https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Swap#Using_a_Swapfile">create a swapfile rather than adjusting my partitions to have a swap partition</a>. Since there are 4 GB of RAM in the Pinebook Pro, I ended up creating a 4 GB swap file. Once it&rsquo;s created you can verify it by looking at <code>htop</code> or running <code>swapon</code>. If you&rsquo;re concerned about the amount of storage on the eMMC, you can see how much you&rsquo;re using via:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">df -H | grep /$
</code></pre></div><h3 id="typing-and-the-touchpad">Typing and the Touchpad<a href="#typing-and-the-touchpad" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed on occasion is that typing does not disable the touchpad on the laptop, meaning that it&rsquo;s easy for your hand to accidentally brush it, clicking somewhere else and causing a bit of havoc on whatever it is you&rsquo;re trying to do. I&rsquo;ve accidentally done it once just while working on this article. I&rsquo;ve not found a solution for this yet (I&rsquo;ll update the post if I do), but it hasn&rsquo;t been a big deal for me. It&rsquo;s just something to be mindful about.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End<a href="#the-end" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>On the whole, I&rsquo;m <em>extremely</em> pleased with my switch to Manjaro. If you&rsquo;re running a Pinebook Pro with the original Debian build, I&rsquo;d highly recommend giving Manjaro a shot; it honestly feels like a whole new device afterward.</p>
<p>Keep the <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/blog/its-all-about-open-source">open source love alive</a>, and stay pink!</p>
