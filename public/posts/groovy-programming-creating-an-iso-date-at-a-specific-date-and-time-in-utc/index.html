        <p>I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that the title of this post is a <strong>bit</strong> too verbose, but if someone else had a post online with a title like this it could&rsquo;ve potentially saved me a lot of time. Here&rsquo;s to hoping it helps someone else in their search.</p>
<p>As is mentioned on my <a href="https://jfabhd.com/">personal website</a>, I do a lot of PowerShell and Python scripting for work. Recently, though, I started working in Groovy due to the fact that it&rsquo;s treated as a first-class language in a system I&rsquo;ve been integrating SaaS applications into. Without going into a big tl;dr, working in Groovy affords me a lot of convenience, security, and speed benefits. I just had to, you know, learn Groovy. Since there was a sale at Udemy at the time, I ended up snagging <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-groovy/">The Complete Apache Groovy Developer Course</a>. It wasn&rsquo;t a bad course in getting me up to speed; I went from never using Groovy (though I did use Java, upon which Groovy is based, <em>many</em> years ago in college) to being able to get things done for work with it in about 4 nights of binge-watching the course. Be warned, though, that some of the material is a little dated. For example, the way to build JSON objects covered in the course seems to have been superseded by a far easier method, and when covering REST API requests the instructor opted to use some janky 3rd party library that at the time of this writing hadn&rsquo;t been updated in 6 years or something crazy. I was able to do some searches online and leverage Java tutorials to just figure out how to natively handle REST API calls; your mileage my vary with that depending on your comfort level with REST APIs.</p>
<p>One thing not covered in the course that I needed, though, was how to create a date object in a specific format (ISO) at a specific time (the first day of the current month) in a specific timezone (UTC.) This is a common need for me when filtering time-based events if true time UUIDs aren&rsquo;t available. The key in my experience is to figure out how to get the timezone correct at the creation of the object when you need a specific hour; adjusting the timezone after the fact will result in a new offset that&rsquo;ll make your hour value incorrect.</p>
<p>Being super out of the loop with Java and very new to Groovy, this was a little tricky for me, and it seemed like no one else I was able to find online had my specific need. So after a couple of hours of throwing spaghetti at a virtual wall (i.e. copying and pasting lots of stuff from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>) I eventually got to this; it&rsquo;s probably <a href="https://gist.github.com/JFFail/dabd6ab1334fb00bfe5e089d8072ac3c">easier to read at the Gist link</a>:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>I essentially needed to take the current month and year in order to create a date object at midnight (00:00:00) on the first of the month. I need that to be in UTC, and the resulting string representation needs to be in ISO format. All of this gets me what I need so that I can plug it into an API URL for time-based filtering.</p>
<p>Everything works pretty much like you&rsquo;d expect, though the format specified on line 6 gives me the offset for UTC as <code>0000</code>. The endpoint I was passing the data to wanted it to be <code>00:00</code>. Since I knew I&rsquo;d always have no offsett, I just took a range of the string that cut off the last two zeroes so that I could replace them with &ldquo;:00.&rdquo; I probably could&rsquo;ve done this slightly fancier with some type of &ldquo;00$&rdquo; regex replacement, but this works fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m far from the Groovy master, so as much as I hope this is helpful to someone who finds themselves in the same situation I was in, I&rsquo;d equally welcome someone showing me the better way to do it if one exists. Regardless, hopefully someone else out there will bang their head against the keyboard for a shorter amount of time thanks to this. And if you happen to know a better way, feel free to give me a shout!</p>
<p>Keep coding, and stay <code>#FF66CC</code>!</p>
