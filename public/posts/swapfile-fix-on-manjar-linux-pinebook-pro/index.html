  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>I wrote about a month ago of an update <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/blog/unusually-pink-impressions-pinebook-pro">on my Pinebook Pro</a> after <a href="https://www.unusually.pink/blog/pinebook-pro-follow-up-manjaro-linux">switching to Manjaro Linux</a>. I continue to make heavy use of my Pinebook Pro while I&rsquo;m still social distancing and staying at home, giving me lots of time to work on personal projects without much else to do.</p>
<p>Today I ran into an interesting issue, though, after applying a round of updates. I mentioned in my last Pinebook Pro post about going through the process of creating a swapfile using the <a href="https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Swap#Using_a_Swapfile">directions from the Manjaro wiki</a> so that I could hibernate the machine and get <em>much</em> better battery life. I literally just opened the device back up, though, and saw a familiar message that there wasn&rsquo;t enough swap space to successfully hibernate the machine, leaving me with about 20% less battery life than I had been expecting. Running <code>htop</code> quickly showed me that my swap space was back to nothing. Weird.</p>
<p>Following the instructions, my swapfile is literally called <strong>swapfile</strong> on the root of the filesystem. I verified it was still in place with:</p>
<pre><code>ll / | grep swap
</code></pre><p>With the file still in place, I ran through the instructions again. These ones were both successful:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo chmod u=rw,go= /swapfile
</code></pre><p>I got an error when running this, though:</p>
<pre><code>sudo swapon /swappfile
</code></pre><p>This told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>swapon: /swapfile: swapon failed: Invalid argument</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weird. I verified that I still had my swapfile entry in <code>/etc/fstab</code> to assign the swapfile on boot by running:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cat /etc/fstab
</code></pre><p>I tried running the <code>swapon</code> command a different way to have it apply everything in the <code>fstab</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo swapon -a
</code></pre><p>This gave me another &ldquo;Invalid argument&rdquo; error still referencing &ldquo;/swapfile&rdquo;. At this point, I took to the Internet. After a couple of searches, I stumbled across <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/294600/i-cant-enable-swap-space-on-centos-7">a matching Stack Exchange question</a>. The top answer claims that the issue is the initial <code>fallocate</code> command used to create the file (the same command used in the Manjaro wiki) doesn&rsquo;t physically allocate the 4 GB on the storage for speed, but that&rsquo;s apparently problematic for <code>swapon</code>. Following that answer, I ran a <code>dd</code> command to replace my swapfile with something physically allocated:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile count=4096 bs=1MiB
</code></pre><p>This takes a few moments to run, especially on the eMMC storage of the Pinebook Pro. Once it completed, though, I repeated the other commands and verified they were all successful. Sure enough, running <code>htop</code> once again shows my 4 GB of allocated swap space.</p>
